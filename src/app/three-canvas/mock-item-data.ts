To make precise prediction about boundary-layer transition points, it is required to understand the fundamental physics behind it. Although some key mechanisms are enlightened with recent studies, there are still unsolved part of this complex physics. Process of transformation of external disturbances into instability waves which grow in the downstream and causes to turbulence is called as receptivity. Small solid particles suspended in the atmosphere may be a significant source of boundary-layer instabilities. Their sizes in micro scales. Since particulate sizes are very small, fine meshes are used to catch the small disturbances that is induced by these small particulates and this makes parallelizing the solver inevitable. For more complex cases, heterogonous and exascale computing is required to obtain the results in a practical time period. In this poster, progress towards a physics-based parallel direct numerical simulation (DNS) tool to simulate the dynamic interaction of particulates, particulate-induced vortical disturbances, acoustic waves, and surface roughness with boundary-layer from the first principles will be presented."],

A previous investigation descriptively characterized these metrics for 61 exams at the Oklahoma State University College of Osteopathic Medicine, however, the distribution characteristics remain unknown. The primary objective of this study was to determine the normality of the item Difficulty, DI, and PB for these 61 exams. Using the software suite R (version 4.0.2) and RStudio (Version 1.3.959) we performed graphical and numerical analysis of normality using both Q-Q plots (ggqqplot), and the Shapiro-Wilk Normality Test (ggpubr) as adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. For item Difficulty, 93.4% of exams had statistically significant deviations from normality. For DI, 63.9% of exams had statistically significant deviations form normality. For PB, 11.5% of exams had statistically significant deviations from normality. Our results suggest that item performance indicators vary drastically in their distribution characteristics within our sample. Our findings support the use of inferential statistics relying the assumption normality for PB but not item Difficulty or DI. These results may be useful for curriculum directors and test-writers."],

This poster will introduce attendees to the TRAIL (Technical Report Archive and Image Library) Project and why this is a unique source for a variety of topics such as climate studies from research labs and agencies like the Corps of Engineers. Technical reports have always been challenging because of inconsistent and differing dissemination practices, no title level cataloging, and series level records with no holdings making it challenging to get technical reports via ILL. TRAIL is digitizing federal agency technical reports in print and microformats and cataloging them at the item level and depositing them in the HathiTrust and University of North Texas digital repositories where they are viewable to anyone in the world. Attendees can also learn more about Technical Reports and TRAIL and how to publicize this resource to their patrons."],

We developed curriculum based on The Carpentries lessons in order to offer shorter, 1 – 2.5-hour workshops more frequently than the typical two-day Carpentries workshops. We organized the workshops into three categories to reflect researcher needs: Survival Skills to teach research data basics (such as backups, data formatting, and file organization); Better Practices to teach data practices that many researchers will use but may not be applicable to all individuals (such as version control and data management plans); and Workflow Tools to teach specific beginner and intermediate tools (such as graphing in R and Python and formatting documents in LaTeX). Slides, instructor notes, and workshop materials are available to the community at OU and beyond through Open Science Framework with a CC-BY license to facilitate curriculum sharing. This poster will outline the various workshops we offer, campus participation thus far, and some feedback from learners."],

Natural disasters, economic downturns and, most recently, global pandemics have a way of bringing data to the front of people's minds. So, how does data (or lack of it) shape our response to these events? With clients in nearly every industry, data consulting firm InterWorks plays a unique role in helping others address these challenges. In this session, InterWorks Communications Manager Garrett Sauls will draw from the collective experience of the global InterWorks team to paint a broad picture of how different organizations are using data to respond to the current Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. He'll also share some useful resources to help you dive into the data on your own."],

Meanwhile, incorrect coding (e.g. up-coding) is considered by authorities to be one of the most important frauds with severe penalties. Therefore, accurate coding is of great importance to medical professionals. However, claims coding is challenging. Besides the knowledge of the E/M coding system, accurate coding requires an adequate depiction of patient health conditions and treatments, part of which are contained in unstructured clinical notes, e.g. discharge summaries and physician notes. We aim to develop a coding decision support system by leveraging state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) techniques and algorithms. The expected result of the project is to build an effective system that can extract essential information for claims coding from real clinical narratives. This phase-1 study compared five popular existing NLP software in named entity recognition based on 108 public available transcribed medical discharge summary notes from MTsamples.com. Qualitative comparison finds that CLAMP, Amazon Comprehend Medical, and cTAKES are more powerful. Quantitative analysis shows that CLAMP is more accurate and efficient than Amazon Comprehend Medical. Future work includes integrating a section segmentation tool before NER recognition as well as testing and implementation of the system in a clinical scenario."],

The University of Oklahoma (OU) has been awarded a National Science Foundation grant that has acquired, and will deploy and maintain, for 8+ years, a large scale storage resource -- the OU & Regional Research Store (OURRstore) -- to enable faculty, staff, postdocs, graduate students and undergraduates to pursue data-intensive research, by building large and growing data collections, to share these datasets with collaborators and even the public, and to provide this capability to all institutions in (a) the Great Plains Network and (b) Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) jurisdictions. Via an innovative, low cost business model, researchers will buy their own tape cartridges, good for 8+ years, and pay zero usage charges (just cartridge and shipping costs).

Using the Mobility domain of the ICF as a framework, we comprehensively analyze the structure and characteristics of mobility related concepts found in physical therapy notes from the National Institutes of Health’s Clinical Center. The result is a mobility entity framework comprised of 5 entities types, 3 relations, 8 attributes, and 33 attribute values. Two domain experts manually curated a gold standard corpus of 14,281 nested entity mentions from 400 clinical notes. Inter-annotator agreement (IAA) of exact matching averaged 92.3% F1-score on mention text spans, and 96.6% Cohen’s kappa on attributes assignments. A novel ensemble machine learning model for named entity recognition was trained and evaluated using the gold standard corpus. Average F1-score on exact entity matching of our ensemble method (83.31%) outperformed both baseline methods: a probabilistic graphical model (80.4%), and an artificial neural network (81.82%). Overcoming the irregularities and challenges in capturing functioning concepts, this work pioneers a representational framework, an annotated gold standard corpus, and a cutting-edge machine learning model that identify concepts in the Mobility domain of the ICF."],

The following is a perplexing case of abdominal pain that presented to our University clinic.\r\n\r\nCASE DESCRIPTION: A 43-year-old female with a past medical history of diabetes and hypertension presented to the clinic with a chief complaint of generalized abdominal pain. The pain started about 6 months prior and occurred about every 4 weeks, and typically lasting for 3-4 days. The patient had tried many over-the-counter treatments including TUMS and Maalox. There was an improvement with bowel movements. She described the abdominal pain as a throbbing with no radiation. She denied any urinary symptoms, vaginal bleeding, vomiting, or hematochezia. She had approximately 45 pounds of unintentional weight loss during this time. On exam, the abdomen was soft, nontender to palpation, and nondistended. Bowel sounds were present in all four quadrants. There was no hepatosplenomegaly. Of note, patient had a history of diabetes mellitus type II and was currently taking metformin 1000mg BID and dulaglutide 1.5mg weekly. The patient had been on this regimen for approximately 11 months. The initial differential included IBS, IBD, iatrogenic, and anxiety. Lab work was obtained and included a CBC, ESR, and CRP. The CBC was remarkable for an eosinophil count of 1710; the ESR was elevated at 28. The CRP was unremarkable. A Stool Ova and Parasites was negative. Due to the elevated eosinophil count, the patient was referred to Gastroenterology who performed an abdominal ultrasound, EGD, and colonoscopy. The abdominal ultrasound was normal. The EGD inspection was normal. The biopsy showed some mild inflammation and was negative for H. pylori. The colonoscopy was only remarkable for diverticulosis. Given the negative workup, it was determined this patient was likely suffering from irritable bowel syndrome. \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION: Abdominal pain is a common complaint in primary care settings and emergency departments. The differential should include iatrogenic causes and abdominal migraines, along with the more common causes including IBS, IBD, H. pylori infection, and gastritis. This patient presented with a lengthy differential diagnosis given her comorbidities, medications, and eosinophilia. Given those findings, an EGD and Colonoscopy were warranted in order to exclude eosinophilic gastroenteritis, IBD, and Celiac Disease. IT is important to remember that Irritable Bowel Syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion, and this case required an extensive workup to exclude it."],

      abstract: ["INTRODUCTION: Congenital Syphilis (CS) is an infection caused by the spirochete Treponema Pallidum. It’s transmitted predominantly via the placenta, and only severe cases are clinically apparent at birth. Its incidence has risen sharply, with the CDC reporting 1306 cases in 2018, a 40% increase from 2017 nationally with a 92% increase in Oklahoma alone.\r\n\r\nCASE DESCRIPTION: A 28-year-old mom with no prenatal care and a positive admit maternal syphilis antibody underwent C-section and delivered a newborn female infant weighing at 3020 g with APGARS 6 and 9 at a gestational age of 38w5d. Maternal history was significant for illicit drug use and positive UDS for methamphetamine and marijuana prior to delivery. NB exam showed hypotonia, low-set ears, flattened nasal bridge, 2/6 holosystolic murmur, hepatomegaly, scattered petechiae on the back, an erythematous ring-shaped lesion on right palm, and another similar lesion on right foot. NB admission was complicated by hypoglycemia, thrombocytopenia and hyperbilirubinemia. Patient was admitted to NICU soon after delivery. Lumbar puncture with CSF analysis yielded RPR 1:64 and non-reactive VDRL. ECHO showed a small PFO. A diagnosis of CS was made anda 10-day course of IV Penicillin G was initiated. LFT showed transaminitis and TPN/SMOF was begun. Abdominal ultrasound confirmed hepatomegaly and HIDA scan results were consistent with severe hepatocellular dysfunction without exclusion of biliary atresia. The lowest direct bilirubin was 1.96 and lowest platelet level was 30. One platelet transfusion was administered and Ursodiol 10 mg/kgs was initiated. She was discharged with Ursodiol 15 mg/kgs and will be following up with the Audiology, Hepatology, Gastroenterology, Infectious Disease, and Opthalmology pending referral from PCP.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION: This case illustrates the various clinical findings seen in classic CS as well as those unique to our patient. Interestingly, our patient had a healthy birthweight, whereas classic CS patients are four times more likely to have low birth weights. Distinctive features of this case include the ring-shaped skin lesions as large as 2 cm in diameter which were present at birth. The rash of CS usually appears later on in the disease course and consists of small brown/copper colored spots on the palm or soles. Another noteworthy finding in this case was the severe involvement of the liver requiring treatment with Ursodiol. Although early diagnosis and treatment is linked to better outcomes, our patient’s vast hepatocellular dysfunction may be an indicator of a poorer prognosis. The rising prevalence of CS may make these exam findings more common."],

      abstract: ["INTRODUCTION: Hyponatremia is defined as low sodium within the blood that can lead to headache, balance and gait issues, confusion, seizures, or even death in severe cases. However, in some instances a low sodium value on laboratory studies is not a true representation of sodium concentration. This is pseudohyponatremia. One known cause of pseudohyponatremia is extreme elevations in triglycerides in the blood. When lipids replace the water within the serum, a low sodium number will be recorded but will not be accurate. We describe a case of pseudohyponatremia in the setting of severe hypertriglyceridemia.\r\n\r\nCASE DESCRIPTION: extreme anxiety and confusion. She was recently prescribed 30 tablets of Ativan for her anxiety, a prescription that she regularly obtained, leading to a question of Ativan overdose. Her clinic labs from one week ago noted a sodium of 126. She was sent to the Emergency Department for further evaluation of confusion and agitation with concerns of overdose versus further worsening of hyponatremia. Though her triglycerides were elevated at 1,409 on recent labs, further assessment was warranted to confirm pseudohyponatremia. At the ED, her hyponatremia was worse than previously at 119. She was given IV saline and fluid restriction, and admitted to the hospital for further management of hyponatremia. A lipid panel was obtained which showed triglyceride level of 8,520, resulting in a diagnosis of pseudohyponatremia in the setting of severe hypertriglyceridemia. She was subsequently discharged the following day with instructions to follow up with her primary care physician for antihyperlipidemic medication and lifestyle measures.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION: Without evidence of pancreatitis, she was not treated with plasmapheresis or discharged home with an antihyperlipidemic medication. The pseudohyponatremia-associated low sodium value left her delirium and agitation unresolved. She returned to clinic for discussion of her severe anxiety and was referred to psychiatry. Ativan was discontinued due to her risk of overuse. She was then lost to follow up as she cancelled her next four clinic appointments. Although hyponatremia is often a result of dehydration or other common causes including diuretic use, SIADH, and renal failure, pseudohyponatremia should be present in a differential. This case serves as a reminder to explore other possibilities when an abnormal lab result is obtained. A lipid panel is not always a routine part of a hyponatremia work up, but maybe should be when suspicion of common causes is low."],

      abstract: ["INTRODUCTION: The development of valvular incompetence and/or obstruction in the pelvic and gonadal veins causing disabling symptoms comprises Pelvic Congestion Syndrome (PCS). It is a less known pathologic condition commonly occurring in women of child bearing age, and diagnosis can be challenging due to a variety of clinical presentations. Nutcracker syndrome (NCS) is a potential cause of PCS and involves compression of the left renal vein between the superior mesenteric artery and the aorta. We report one such case of a woman who presented with chronic pelvic pain.\r\n\r\nCASE DESCRIPTION: Our patient is a 31-year-old woman evaluated in our clinic with 6 years of unbearable back and suprapubic pain associated with dyspareunia and dysuria. She underwent evaluation by her gynecologist, and a transvaginal ultrasound demonstrated vaginal varicosities. Computed tomography angiogram (CTA) showed dilated left ovarian vein contiguous with left greater than right pelvic varicosities. We then performed a diagnostic venogram that demonstrated left pelvic venous plexus consistent with pelvic varicosities in the left ovarian vein and NCS anatomy. We decided to treat the PCS first. The patient underwent foam sclerotherapy of the pelvic venous plexus using 3cc of foam sclerosing agent (polidocanol) followed by coil embolization of the left ovarian vein. Post embolization venogram demonstrated radiographically successful treatment with no flow in the ovarian vein and preserved flow in the left renal vein.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION: Chronic pelvic pain due to pelvic congestion is often associated with a constellation of symptoms including pelvic pain, dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, and dysuria causing negative cognitive, behavioral, sexual and emotional consequences. There are three types of chronic pelvic pain, categorized by etiology. Type I is secondary to valvular incompetence of pelvic or ovarian veins, Type II is secondary to obstruction of outflow, and Type III is due to local compression. Venography is the gold standard for diagnosis. Treatment is directed at providing symptomatic relief with medical therapy, and treating the underlying cause by either endovascular (sclerotherapy and embolization, left renal venous stent placement) or open surgical techniques (including gonadal vein transposition, left renal vein transposition, or saphenous vein bypass)."],

The exact cause of Kawasaki Disease remains unknown; however, a combination of clinical symptoms, including fever, conjunctival congestion, cervical lymphadenopathy, and changes in oral cavity and peripheral extremities, confirm the diagnosis.\r\n\r\nCASE DESCRIPTION: A ten-year-old, ill-appearing Latina female presented to her primary pediatrician with a swollen face, left-sided subconjunctival hemorrhage, and mild erythematous rash on both arms and legs. Three days prior to presentation, she was seen at an ED due to emesis, abdominal pain, a painful pruritic erythematous rash on her hands, and an erythematous, blanching, maculopapular rash diffusely across her body. At that time, her conjunctivas were clear and her posterior pharynx was erythematous without exudates. A Rapid Strep A Screen administered at the ED was negative. While at the pediatrician’s clinic, another Rapid Strep test was conducted and remained negative. A urine analysis indicated large bilirubin and ketones with trace blood, protein and leukocytes. The patient was admitted to the pediatric inpatient service.\r\n\r\nThe patient remained in the hospital for five days, and remained febrile for four days with a maximum temperature of 102°F. During admission, labs demonstrated an elevated ESR and CRP . She was treated with doxycycline for suspected tick-borne illness, pending additional lab results, and sent home.\r\n\r\nThe patient returned to the clinic three days post-discharge reporting nausea and vomiting. The family reported her having a purple/blue tongue two days prior. On physical exam, she had a strawberry-like tongue and a desquamating rash on her palms, soles and peri-inguinal area. She was once again readmitted where her labs showed transaminitis, elevated CRP and ESR, and thrombocytosis. An echocardiogram indicated no abnormalities. Based on prior medical history, a presumptive diagnosis of Kawasaki Disease was made. The patient was treated with IVIG and 81mg ASA daily which was successful.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION: This case demonstrates a rare presentation of Kawasaki Disease, with 11 days of symptoms until clinic diagnosis. This diagnosis requires purposeful questioning, along with clinical, and lab findings. Recognition of this syndrome is critical due to its potential to cause fatal coronary artery aneurysms. After appropriate treatment with IVIG and ASA, every child should follow up with pediatric cardiology to ensure that no cardiac issues arise due to this disease. This atypical presentation of Kawasaki Disease should remind clinicians to always be aware of the diverse manners in which this syndrome may appear."],

      abstract: ["INTRODUCTION: In 2016 the World Health Organization proclaimed a hepatitis C virus (HCV) elimination goal of a 90% decrease in new infections by 2030. Some providers are facing this prevalent disease through an organization called ‘Project ECHO’, Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes, with Oklahoma State University Center for Health Sciences. Funded by OSU-CHS and Cherokee Nation Health Services, this collaborative model connects an interdisciplinary team of infectious disease physicians and pharmacists with community providers to discuss treatment for complex medical conditions. This unique resource proved valuable in providing additional care for an uninsured, chronic HCV patient in the Bedlam Longitudinal Clinic. She became the first patient of the Bedlam free clinics to be evaluated by the ECHO team and receive treatment.\r\n\r\nCASE DESCRIPTION: The patient is a 60-year-old female with Hepatitis C diagnosed in 1981 after a blood transfusion secondary to a C-section. She is uninsured and treatment naïve. When she presented to the clinic there were concerns for hepatic fibrosis and decompensated disease. Along with a 20-pound weight loss within one year, her physical exam revealed a palpable liver 2-3 cm beyond the costal margin and a positive fluid wave. Her AFP was 7.5 and increased to 9.1 four months later, which led to obtaining an unremarkable abdominal ultrasound with the recommendation for a follow-up CT scan. Her case was presented to the ECHO team who collaborated to formulate recommendations for continuing her work-up, beginning treatment, and disease monitoring upon treatment completion. Based on their expert recommendations, the patient received a triple phase liver CT scan through the Medical Access Program (MAP) and a pharmaceutical patient assistance program approved free treatment with Epclusa. \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION: When this patient presented to clinic, she believed HCV treatment would never be an option for her financially. There was an underlying fear she would become decompensated or develop hepatocellular carcinoma for which her risk is high. Without the pro-bono support from the ECHO team and assistance programs, her opportunity for treatment would have likely been delayed without expert guidance or denied entirely. For the first time in 39 years, this patient will be able to move forward knowing HCV will be her past and not her future."],

      abstract: ["INTRODUCTION: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) represents a potentially life-threatening condition that requires proper surveillance and treatment. While AAA was historically treated by open surgical repair, technologic advances have resulted in Endovascular Aortic Aneurysm repair (EVAR) becoming the primary repair technique for AAA. Persistent endoleaks are a known complication of EVAR that often require additional intervention. We present a case highlighting the management of a Type 1B endoleak post-EVAR.\r\n\r\nCASE DESCRIPTION: Our patient is a 66-year-old male with history of EVAR at outside facility, and was evaluated in clinic with an enlarging iliac artery aneurysm. Computed tomography angiogram (CTA) demonstrated a 5cm aneurysmal degeneration of the right common iliac artery, most likely due to an endoleak in the distal portion of the stent (Type 1B). Due to the existing aortic endograft with a high flow divider, this required a combined axillary and femoral artery approach. The patient underwent placement of iliac branch endoprosthesis (IBE) at the right common iliac artery bifurcation with limb extension into both the external iliac and hypogastric arteries. Completion angiogram demonstrated successful extension of the endograft with exclusion of both the AAA and iliac aneurysm, preserved patency of the right hypogastric artery, and no endoleak.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION: Endoleaks are a known complication of EVAR and frequently require intervention. There are multiple type of endoleak. Type 1 endoleaks denote leaks due to inadequate seal, and are divided further into 1A (proximal seal zone) and 1B (distal seal zone). Type II are due to branch vessel, type III endoleak are due to graft connection, and type IV due to graft porosity. The identification of location and type is frequently challenging and requires an angiogram. The management is based on the type of leak. Our patient had a type IB, due to leakage around the distal right common iliac limb. Relining the endograft with placement of an IBE device and extension of the stents into the external iliac and hypogastric arteries ensured development of adequate seal while preserving blood flow distally. With extensive pre-operative case planning and an intricate knowledge of the vascular anatomy, the modern vascular surgeon is equipped to provide advanced endovascular treatment options for complex vascular conditions."],

      abstract: ["INTRODUCTION: \r\nWhile peptic ulcers can occur after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgeries, they are most commonly found as marginal ulcers at the gastrojejunal anastomosis and amenable to standard endoscopy. Peptic ulcers that occur in the gastric remnant and duodenum are less common and pose significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges due to their inability to be accessed by esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). We report one such case of a woman who presented with CT findings suggestive of a gastric remnant ulcer who underwent laparoscopic assisted endoscopy of gastric remnant and duodenum.\r\n\r\nCASE DESCRIPTION: A 53-year-old female who underwent a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass nine years prior presented to clinic with three weeks of sharp post-prandial abdominal pain radiating to the back. CT imaging of the abdomen was suspicious for inflammation and a possible ulcer in the anterior antrum of the gastric remnant without any free air. She was placed on a proton pump inhibitor by gastroenterology and then referred to surgery as this area was not accessible by EGD secondary to her gastric bypass. The patient subsequently underwent a laparoscopic lysis of adhesions, laparoscopic assisted endoscopy of gastric remnant and duodenum, and upper endoscopy of esophagus, gastric bypass, and distal extent of roux limb. She was discovered to have a duodenal ulcer. Biopsies taken from the gastric antrum and duodenum were negative for Helicobacter pylori or malignancy.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION: Morbid obesity is a debilitating illness that has resulted in a growing volume of bariatric surgery. Sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass are the two most predominate weight loss surgeries performed currently in the United States. Proficiency in evaluating and treating complications of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is imperative for management of bariatric patients, which includes evaluation for peptic ulcers and other pathology in the gastric remnant and duodenum. Endoscopy evaluation of the gastric remnant and duodenum cannot be performed trans-orally. This case demonstrates a laparoscopic assisted trans-gastric access for endoscopic evaluation of the duodenum and gastric remnant for peptic ulcer disease."],

      abstract: ["INTRODUCTION: Widespread pulmonary calcification is a relatively uncommon finding in patients presenting with dyspnea; differential diagnosis is limited, particularly when accompanied by a diffuse “sandstorm” appearance on plain radiographs. Pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis (PAM) is an extremely rare genetic disease characterized by deposition of calcium phosphate microliths choking the alveoli and small airways.\r\n\r\nCASE DESCRIPTION: A 33-year-old female immigrant from the Mediterranean region presented for acute on chronic dyspnea. Her 10-year history of exertional dyspnea was punctuated by two days of acute, unremitting, exertional and resting dyspnea with associated fever, pleurisy, and anxiety. Initial room air oximetry was 68%, increasing to 92% on 2L supplemental oxygen. Exam showed cachexia, tachypnea without accessory muscle usage, and diffuse bronchial breath sounds. Laboratory evaluation revealed polycythemia, and computed tomography showed essentially complete lung opacification with diffuse confluent sand-type calcific opacities with air bronchograms. Extensive inpatient workup for a precipitating infectious or rheumatologic etiology of acute decline was largely fruitless, including blood and sputum cultures, atypical respiratory panel, fungal cultures, and autoimmune workup. Quantiferon gold testing was positive. Bronchoalveolar lavage showed scattered calcified concretions. She was discharged on supplemental oxygen to follow up with an interstitial lung disease specialist and complete latent tuberculosis treatment. She was unfortunately lost to follow up after returning to her home country.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION: Lung tissue calcification can be organized into three main categories: metastatic calcification (i.e., deposition in normal tissue due to systemic disease); dystrophic calcification (i.e., deposition due to trauma or previously abnormal tissue), and PAM – a rare genetic mutation producing an abnormal type IIb sodium phosphate cotransporter in alveolar type II cells, from mutation of the SLC34A2 gene1. The dysfunctional cotransporter fails to clear phosphate from degraded surfactant, resulting in microlith accumulation, chronic inflammation, tissue destruction, pulmonary fibrosis, and respiratory failure2,3. PAM has been diagnosed in 65 countries and is most common in Asia. There is a spectrum of disease severity; some patients present asymptomatically, discovered based on incidental abnormal radiographs, and some present in respiratory failure. CT chest plus bronchoscopy with bonchoalveolar lavage is typically used for diagnosis. Clinical course varies but most patients progress to respiratory failure and cor pulmonale. Currently the only definitive treatment is lung transplantation1.\r\n\r\nWidespread or multifocal calcification is rare. When diffuse alveolar calcific disease is present, the differential should include metastatic pulmonary calcification and pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis. In our patient, progression of her underlying lung pathology was suspected as etiology of progressively worsening dyspnea."],

PAU can have an associated intraluminal aortic thrombus, with associated risk of thromboembolism with subsequent mesenteric infarct and limb loss. We present a case of persistent descending thoracic aortic thrombus, with embolic renal infarcts, necessitating repair.\r\n\r\nCASE DESCRIPTION: A 80-year-old woman with history of bilateral renal infarcts on Eliquis and uncontrolled hypertension was referred to our department for extensive aortic atherosclerosis and 6mm ulceration proximal to the celiac artery, demonstrated on a CT. A follow up Computed Tomography Angiogram (CTA) demonstrated a persistent descending thoracic aortic thrombus and thoracic endovascular repair (TEVAR) was indicated. Preoperative imaging demonstrated >50% stenosis of the distal left common femoral artery (CFA).\r\n\r\nWe accessed the proximal left CFA and subsequently placed stent grafts in the descending thoracic aorta, distally to proximally. Completion aortogram revealed complete occlusion in left external iliac artery. Doppler signals to the left foot were diminished on prompt exam.\r\n\r\nCurrent intraoperative imaging showed thromboembolism vs. flow-limiting dissection in the left CFA and external iliac arteries. Given these findings, an open endarterectomy of the iliac arteries was indicated, along with stent graft deployment in the left external iliac artery and bilateral stents in the common iliac arteries.\r\n\r\nA complete angiogram revealed a flow-limiting thromboembolism in the left superficial femoral artery (SFA). This was treated with covered stent placement, excluding the thrombus. Subsequent imaging demonstrated brisk flow into the left foot. On exam, pulses were palpable in the feet bilaterally and she moved all extremities. This patient had an uneventful hospital course and was discharge on postoperative day three.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION: PAUs are a collective part of Acute Aortic Syndrome (AAS), seen in 2-8% of patients with AAS. PAUs develop from aortic mural thrombi, located most frequently in the abdominal aorta. A PAU > 4mm thick with ulceration is categorized as a complex plaque and warrants surgical repair. Anticoagulation is not sufficient for complex plaques. Endovascular repair (EVAR) is preferred to open since operating time is shorter, involves smaller incisions, and decreased hospital stay, with improved perioperative morbidity and all-cause mortality. Employing quality vascular access and wire manipulation can reduce endoleaks, access complications, and peripheral embolization. If complications arise, prompt imaging to access the stenotic vessels is necessary. This case demonstrates the potential morbidity of aortic thrombus embolization and the attention to detail required for successful treatment."],

      abstract: ["INTRODUCTION: Coarctation of the aorta (CoA) is a congenital heart disease characterized by narrowing of the aorta near the aortic isthmus. The incidence of CoA is 4 out of every 10,000 births, accounting for 6–8% of all congenital heart disease. It is common for CoA to be accompanied by other cardiovascular abnormalities, such as bicuspid aortic valve, ventricular septal defects, and mitral valve stenosis. Early diagnosis and treatment of CoA is crucial to improving morbidity and mortality associated with this disease as the mean age of death in untreated coarctation is 34 years.\r\n\r\nCASE DESCRIPTION: A 10 year old male presented to the outpatient pediatric clinic for an acute illness. On examination, he was found to be hypertensive with a blood pressure of 126/69 accompanied by a systolic heart murmur. Medical history included the diagnosis of a heart murmur at a 2 year well child examination before the patient was lost to follow-up until age 9. Upon re-establishment he was noted to have a II/VI systolic heart murmur. He was seen multiple times during year 10 of life where this murmur was consistently documented. Referral to cardiology for further evaluation was made. At presentation to the cardiologist, patient was found to be well appearing with clear lung sounds and a III/VI systolic murmur heard best at the left upper sternal boarder with radiation throughout the chest. During examination absent femoral and lower extremity pulses with pale lower extremity nail beds were also noted. Echocardiogram demonstrated severe CoA, bicuspid aortic valve, and aortic root dilatation. He was started on metoprolol for aortic root dilatation. Referral for heart catheterization was made for planned stenting to relieve the coarctation.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION: Heart murmurs are a common finding on pediatric exams. The primary care provider typically determines which heart murmurs are pathologic and require follow-up. In the setting of a heart murmur there are clinical signs that indicate when further follow-up with cardiology is needed, including absent distal pulses, hypertension, radiation of the murmur throughout the chest, and discrepancy between upper and lower extremity blood pressure. Early referral to cardiology is imperative for any murmur that is not innocent to prevent delayed diagnosis of pathologic lesions. This case demonstrates the importance of checking blood pressure and lower extremity pulses in the setting of an asymptomatic patient with a heart murmur."],

      abstract: ["INTRODUCTION: Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT), a rare autosomal dominant disorder also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu Disease, is often underdiagnosed. The initial symptom tends to be spontaneous and recurrent nose bleeds followed by the development of telangiectasias at multiple mucocutaneous locations. In HHT, patients develop arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in the spine, lung, brain, and liver. This case examines the impact of delayed diagnosis of HHT.\r\n\r\nCASE DESCRIPTION: A 36-year-old male with history of alcoholic liver cirrhosis and neurologic deficits due to intraparenchymal hemorrhage (7 months prior) presented to the longitudinal free clinic to establish care and refill seizure medication. On further evaluation, the patient had history of an upper gastrointestinal bleed of unknown etiology in 2013, recurrent spontaneous epistaxis since middle school, telangiectasias on skin and roof of mouth, jaundice, and scleral icterus. Hemoglobin was decreased, but in proportion to his nosebleeds. CT angiogram two months prior showed cerebral AVMs. The diagnosis of HHT was confirmed with three of the four Curacao Criteria. Further evaluation was needed to assess for disease complications including gastrointestinal bleeding and pulmonary and hepatic AVMs. Transthoracic contrast echo with agitated saline, a screen for pulmonary AVMs, was positive. Abdominal ultrasounds showed an AVM in the left lobe of the liver. Due to a continual decrease in hemoglobin, an upper gastrointestinal study was ordered. Interventional radiology and neurovascular specialist  were needed to evaluate possible embolizations of AVMs. Care would ideally be managed at a HHT center but due to the uninsured status of the patient this was challenging.  Patient is currently stable and has not developed any new symptoms since establishing care.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION: Many physicians who manage the complications of this disease are unfamiliar with the genetic condition; therefore, this disorder is often under-diagnosed. Diagnosis is made when three of four Curacao Criteria are met. The criteria are spontaneous and recurrent epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectasia, a first-degree relative with diagnosis, and multi-organ AVMs. An earlier diagnosis could have been made if his previous physicians were more aware of the disease, its associated signs and complications, and had conducted a more thorough history and physical exam. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of HHT was made months after the patient experienced a life-threatening hemorrhagic stroke caused by a cerebral AVM, resulting in neurologic deficits. Hopefully with the knowledge of his diagnosis, physicians will continually screen and evaluate him to prevent serious complications in the future."],

These cysts can arise anywhere along the gastrointestinal tract but are most commonly found in the small intestine. Presenting symptoms vary, but often include: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or distention, obstruction, or a palpable mass.\r\n\r\nCASE DESCRIPTION: An exclusively breastfed eight-month-old female presented to the children’s hospital with severe microcytic anemia (hemoglobin concentration of 3.2 g/dL). Past medical history was significant for a six-month history of emesis and intermittent hematochezia. Around two months of age, she presented to the pediatrician due to intermittent loose, bloody stools, which were attributed to milk protein-induced proctocolitis. Dairy was removed from the mother’s diet, which reportedly provided some improvement. Iron deficiency anemia was diagnosed at four months of age when hemoglobin concentration was 8 g/dL and improved to 10.6 g/dL at six months after the initiation of iron therapy. Follow-up labs at eight months revealed severe microcytic anemia and prompted admission to the children’s hospital. Notably, medical history included a prenatal ultrasound concerning for bilateral ovarian cysts. Repeated postnatal images revealed decreased size of the cysts, and they were deemed insignificant. Upon admission, the patient was pale and tachycardic, but otherwise well appearing with a soft, non-tender, non-distended abdomen, normal bowel sounds, no palpable masses or hepatosplenomegaly. Ultrasound and CT of the abdomen showed bilateral abdominal mesenteric masses favoring mesenteric cysts. Exploratory laparotomy identified a ten cm bilobed retroperitoneal cystic mass and 80 cm of mesenteric duplication at the distal jejunum and proximal ileum closely adherent to native tissues with surrounding mucosal necrosis, ulceration, and hemorrhage. The native bowel could not be salvaged so resection and jejunoileostomy were performed. Hematochezia and anemia resolved after surgical recovery.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION: This case demonstrates hematochezia, a relatively common pediatric complaint, which was suspected to be due to milk protein allergic proctocolitis and resulted in the missed diagnosis of a congenital enteric lesion. Unlike most cases of mesenteric duplication cysts, this patient had no palpable masses or abdominal distension. These lesions were detected by prenatal ultrasound but were dismissed postnatally. Severe microcytic anemia was the only sign of the severity of her illness and the need for prompt surgical management. Anatomic abnormalities discovered prenatally should be surveilled into infancy until they are resolved, corrected, or determined to be benign. Gastrointestinal duplication cyst(s) should be included in differential diagnoses for pediatric patients with unexplained hematochezia refractory to treatment."],

Fusobacterium spp. infections of dental plaque are most common in adolescents and young adults and may lead to periodontal disease. Fusobacterium spp. are capable of causing invasive disease commonly associated with otitis media, tonsillitis with Lemierre syndrome, gingivitis, and oropharyngeal trauma.\r\n\r\nCASE DESCRIPTION: A previously healthy 16-year-old, Hispanic male initially presented with a three day history of fevers, chest pain, and lower back pain and acutely developed headache, neck pain, and vomiting. Broad spectrum empiric antibiotics were promptly started. Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) was concerning for bacterial meningitis with white blood cell (WBC) count of 18,440 with 91% segmented neutrophils, red blood cells (RBC) 1260, Glucose 34, and Protein 222. Pre-treated CSF Gram stain and culture were negative. MRI of the brain showed numerous ring-enhancing lesions within bilateral cerebral hemispheres and brainstem concerning for multiple cerebral abscesses versus Neurocysticercosis (NCC). Fungal studies and immune studies including HIV and TB testing were all negative. Neuroimaging was reviewed with national NCC experts who did not feel the imaging was consistent with NCC. Serum serology sent to CDC for Neurocysticercosis testing ultimately returned negative. CSF 16s PCR analysis for fungal and broad range bacterial pathogens resulted as Fusobacterium nucleatum. Triple antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and metronidazole was continued for eight weeks. Repeat CSF analysis showed remarkable improvement with WBC 169, RBC 146, Glucose 29, and Protein 68. Repeat MRI of the brain after finishing antibiotic therapy showed ring-enhancing lesions remarkably decreased in size and number with no new lesions demonstrated.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION: This case illustrates a very rare cause of brain abscesses in an immunocompetent adolescent with dental braces as the probable source of oropharyngeal infection. Further discussion with family and patient indicated that his oral hygiene routine was poor which likely lead to periodontal disease and ultimately dissemination of the organism to the brain. The diagnosis was ultimately established by 16s PCR analysis. The combination therapy with Metronidazole and Beta-lactams is recommended for an invasive disease. Because the patient was presumed to have meningitis, he received broad spectrum antibiotics which sterilized his CSF culture. This intriguing case of an uncommon cause of brain abscesses prompts further investigation of the role of Fusobacterium nucleatum causing disseminated disease in a healthy population."],

Supraclavicular lymph node excisional biopsy showed focal areas containing lympho-histiocytic infiltrate and immunochemistry stain with CD68 of the lymph node was positive for histiocytes, consistent with proliferative phase of Kikuchi-Fujimoto lymphadenitis.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION: Here is a very rare case of Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease preceded by EBV in a young African-American male. Etiology is unknown but preceding viral etiology has been proposed, such as EBV, HHV-6, HIV, Parvovirus, or Parainfluenza, or even bacterial etiology with Yersinia enterocolitica or Toxoplasma. Although it is a self-limiting condition, patients should be followed within one to four months for recurrence and increased risk of developing systemic lupus erythematosus. This intriguing case of an uncommon cause of right supraclavicular lymphadenitis prompts investigation and recognition by physicians and pathologists to avoid misdiagnosing it as lymphoma and initiating treatment with cytotoxic agents."],

      abstract: ["INTRODUCTION: Traumatic injury to the penis may occur from a wide variety of mechanisms in the context of accidental injury, or child physical or sexual abuse. Accidental penile injuries may include injuries occurring during toilet training in a closing toilet lid, with zippers, hair tourniquets, from straddle injuries, kicks, or more traumatic events such as bike wrecks or automobile accidents. Inflicted penile injury may occur in the context of physical or sexual abuse. The developmental ability, history provided by the caregiver, and other concurrent injuries play an important role in distinguishing between accidental or inflicted trauma.\r\n\r\nCASE DESCRIPTION: A 3 month old male presented to the emergency room due to redness on the glans and shaft of his penis that parents reportedly noticed after a bath. Coagulation studies and complete blood count were obtained which were unremarkable. Social work, Child Protective Services, and Law Enforcement were contacted. He was seen in follow-up the next morning at the Children’s Advocacy Center, where the Child Abuse Pediatrician ordered imaging studies to complete a work-up of possible child physical abuse, including a non-contrast head CT and a full skeletal survey radiography. Head CT was negative. The skeletal survey found bilateral distal medial metaphyseal corner fractures of the femurs, which raised additional concern for child physical abuse and prompted admission to the Children’s Hospital for further management. Pediatric orthopedics was consulted for management of the fractures; treatment included a Pavlik harness which was managed by orthopedics follow up. The patient’s father later admitted during interviews with law enforcement to have forcefully pinched the glans penis in an attempt to stop urination during the patient’s bath. The Child Abuse Pediatrician testified as an expert witness during the trial for this patient, which ultimately found the defendant guilty of child physical abuse.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION: Classifying an injury as accidental, physical abuse, or sexual abuse depends on the setting in which it is reported as well as the intent behind the injury. Multiple accidental mechanisms of injury for the penis bruising were presented prior to the confession; no history was provided for the metaphyseal corner fractures. Child physical abuse was diagnosed due to the additional fractures and lack of history consistent with the injuries. The diagnosis was additionally ultimately supported by the partial confession. This case represents an uncommon presentation of child physical abuse that highlights the need for full appropriate medical evaluation and investigation by coordinating agencies."],

      abstract: ["INTRODUCTION: Inferior Vena Cava (IVC) filters are placed in patients to prevent pulmonary embolism in patients with recurrent deep venous thromboembolism or in high risk patients who cannot tolerate anticoagulation at their initial event. IVC filters are designed as either optional (retrievable) or permanent, and filter selection is based on the indication for placement. We present a case of complex retrieval of two IVC filters from the same patient with a history of chronic venous thromboembolism and post thrombotic syndrome.\r\n\r\nCASE DESCRIPTION: Our patient is a 63 year-old male with a remote history of trauma that resulted in chronic venous thromboembolism and post thrombotic syndrome of left lower extremity. He presents a rare case where he had two separate IVC filters placed during his treatment; initially, a permanent filter was placed, with an additional retrievable filter placed due to recurrent pulmonary emboli. He eventually tolerated anticoagulation, and wanted these filters removed due to their possible contribution to his chronic leg swelling and pain.\r\n\r\nFrom a right internal jugular vein approach, the retrievable superior filter was removed with the conventional snaring technique. We were unable to remove the second filter using conventional snare technique, as well as a through and through “flossing” approach from both jugular and femoral vein access points. We then proceeded with using a 16Fr laser extractor sheath with multiple laser treatments, followed by large aortic balloon expansion from the femoral access site, in an attempt to loosen the filter from the IVC sidewall. This combination of approaches did free the filter from the IVC wall, but the filter remained outside the sheath. Under fluoroscopic visualization, we brought the dislodged filter into the internal jugular vein and, after surgically exposing the vein, successfully removed the filter. Completion venogram confirmed removal of both filters without venous extravasation.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION: This case illustrates the complexity in removing permanent IVC filters in select patients wherein the legs of the filter have embedded into the IVC wall. In patients with higher complexity of IVC filter removal, various methods have been described. Two advanced modes of extraction which are popular are the Endobronchial Forceps Extractions and the Laser-Assist Snare Extraction. Different devices have their unique characteristics and different failure modes. In patients with filter legs embedded in the vessel wall, a more robust approach with laser-assist, balloon endotraction, and external traction to free it from the IVC sidewall may be required for successful retrieval, as in this patient."],

      abstract: ["INTRODUCTION: Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis causes hypertension that is resistant to medical management and may eventually lead to loss of kidney function. The treatment options for uncontrolled hypertension include best medical therapy (BMT), renal artery stenting (RAS), or surgical intervention; however, the optimal modality remains uncertain.   This is the case of a patient with renal artery stenosis complicated by concurrent obstructive uropathy.\r\n\r\nCASE DESCRIPTION: Our patient is a 66-year-old male with a long-standing history of hypertension uncontrolled with BMT  (beta blocker, angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) and a thiazide diuretic) and progressive renal insufficiency which was presumed to be due to prostatic obstructive uropathy. Despite undergoing a transurethral prostatectomy, his renal function continued to decline. A pelvic magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) was performed which showed bilateral renal artery stenosis with the left being worse than the right. Computed tomography angiogram (CTA) was then performed which confirmed significant bilateral renal artery stenosis of 80 percent and 60 percent of the left and right renal artery respectively. The patient then underwent balloon angioplasty followed by stenting of both vessels without complication. Post-stenting angiography showed less than 30 percent stenosis of either vessel. During hospitalization, he had some improvement in his blood pressure, and his renal function was improved from baseline. One month follow up showed no significant change in blood pressure from initial visit prior to stenting.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION: In healthy subjects, reduced renal perfusion lowers the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), causing a response by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) which leads to a compensatory increase in blood pressure. Although the GFR is reduced, renal parenchyma is able to adapt to reduced blood flow if perfusion pressure is reduced by 40 percent. There are a number of ways to manage renal artery stenosis, including RAS versus BMT. Currently, the effects of stenting are controversial and not fully understood. Multiple randomized trails have shown confounding results. Some trails have shown benefit in RAS, while others have demonstrated increase adverse outcomes due to  renal reperfusion. In this case, we decided to to proceed with RAS given the significant stenosis on imaging, the patient's clinical presentation of worsening renal function despite BMT, and having ruled out other causes of progressive renal failure. The decision to intervene  in these patients is usually determined on a case-by-case basis after discussion between surgeon, nephrologist and patient and after educating the patient on the risks and benefits."],

      abstract: ["INTRODUCTION: Malignant catatonia is a life threatening disease and can be difficult to distinguish from other disorders including delirium, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, or exacerbation of mood and psychotic disorders. Catatonia includes three or more of the following symptoms: stupor, catalepsy, waxy flexibility, mutism, negativism, posturing, mannerism, stereotypy, agitation, grimacing, echolalia and echopraxia. Malignant catatonia can include autonomic instability (fever, hypertension, tachycardia), severe muscle rigidity, and nonspecific laboratory findings of leukocytosis and elevated creatinine kinase. This syndrome can lead to severe morbidity and mortality if not promptly treated.\r\n\r\nCASE DESCRIPTION: An 18 year old African American male with no past psychiatric history and a family history of schizophrenia presented with new onset of mania and psychotic symptoms including bizarre, disorganized behavior and emotional outbursts. He initially responded to olanzapine for control of his symptoms, but over time stopped the medication due to side effects. As a result, he had a return of his psychotic symptoms along with waxy flexibility, sleeping for nearly 20 hours each day, restricted affect with minimal speech, and a refusal to eat or drink. The patient responded to a lorazepam challenge putting catatonia on the differential. The patient needed high doses of lorazepam to help with catatonia and severe symptoms of mania and psychosis, including hypersexual behavior, agitation, combativeness, and bizarre and disorganized thought content. With his symptoms, hypertension, and elevated creatine kinase, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) was initiated for treatment of malignant catatonia. He responded well to six sessions with total resolution of symptoms. After discharge, he was admitted to our community assertiveness program and he continued to do well with low dose lorazepam, mood stabilizer and antipsychotic which were added for maintenance treatment of his mood and psychotic symptoms. Over several months, his outpatient psychiatrist slowly tapered the lorazepam and he continues to have good control of his mood and psychotic symptoms with no return of catatonia symptoms.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION: First line treatment of catatonia is scheduled doses of lorazepam. However, in severe cases such as malignant catatonia, ECT should be initiated as soon as possible. The response rate to malignant catatonia is higher with ECT versus treatment with lorazepam alone. On review of case reports, it is beneficial to start ECT within five days of onset of symptoms to lower mortality rates. It is important to have catatonia on a differential diagnosis for patients presenting with mental status changes to ensure timely treatment is initiated."],

Suspected abuse requires additional diagnostic workup and involvement of child protective services and law enforcement. Neonates with concerning injuries present a diagnostic challenge for child abuse pediatricians and medical personnel.\r\n\r\nCASE DESCRIPTION: A 29-day-old male born large for gestation age at 40 weeks gestation with a NICU stay for pulmonary and cardiac problems presented to the hospital with a fever of 105°F. Medical history included propranolol for supraventricular tachycardia. Physical exam indicated boggy swelling of the right parietal area. Septic workup included urinalysis which showed hematuria, elevated white blood cells, leukocyte esterase, and growth of extended spectrum beta lactamase E. coli, confirming sepsis secondary to pyelonephritis. X-ray imaging found right ribs 5-8 with callus formation indicating subacute (>10 days old) rib fractures, resulting in a child abuse pediatrics consult. A skeletal survey showed right posteromedial 5-8 rib fractures. Head CT without contrast showed right occipital parietal soft tissue swelling. Bone mineralization appeared normal, and metabolic bone mineralization workup including osteogenesis imperfecta labs (COL1A1 and COL2A1) was negative. Investigating the birth history revealed good prenatal care but a difficult delivery complicated by six failed vacuum-assist attempts with a pop off, Robertson maneuver, attempted clavicle fracture, and an ultimately successful corkscrew maneuver. Physical abuse was ruled out and a diagnosis of residual birth trauma was made based on the subacute rib fracture callus formation, subgaleal hematoma, and birth history. He completed ten days of piperacillin/tazobactam with complete resolution of pyelonephritis. Repeat skeletal survey was negative for acute fractures.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION: Posterior rib fractures in infants are highly specific and suspicious for abusive injury; however, other causes must be considered when rib fractures are discovered, including birth trauma. Neonatal fractures from routine deliveries are well-documented in the literature, especially in large neonates or with shoulder dystocia. In this case, difficult delivery including shoulder dystocia was pertinent history that aided in the diagnosis of birth trauma. It is imperative that physicians take a detailed history, including birth history, even when the presenting symptom appears not to be directly related. Labs investigating bone development disorders should be obtained when assessing neonatal fractures. The obstetric history in this case led to the retention of a family and spared them unnecessary involvement with law enforcement and child protective services."],

The fungus lives in soil contaminated by bird or bat droppings and is aerosolized and inhaled causing infection. Histoplasmosis is generally a self-limited disease. Most symptomatic patients have acute pulmonary histoplasmosis while immunocompromised patients can have severe pulmonary or disseminated infection. This case emphasizes the importance of considering disseminated histoplasmosis in patients with a fever of unknown etiology.\r\n\r\nCASE DESCRIPTION: A 10-year-old female with Juvenile Dermatomyositis, managed with mycophenolate and methotrexate, presented to the Pediatric Emergency Center with ten days of fever (T max of 103.7°F) and symptoms of myalgia, fatigue, and anorexia. She had no recent travel or significant exposures and immunizations were up to date. Labs were remarkable for a WBC of 2.7 with absolute neutrophil count of 1100, hemoglobin of 11.9 and platelets of 79. Peripheral smear was consistent with mild leukopenia and marked thrombocytopenia. CRP was elevated to 2.46 and ALT to 69. Chest x-ray was negative for infectious process and blood cultures showed no growth. Due to persistent fevers, infectious work-up was broadened to include testing for common respiratory and gastrointestinal pathogens, Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Aspergillus, Bartonella, Brucella, Francisella tularensis, Mycoplasma, and tick-borne illnesses, with all results negative. Due to worsening pancytopenia, a bone marrow biopsy was performed which revealed non-caseating granulomas with fungal yeast forms consistent with Histoplasma capsulatum. Histoplasmosis urine and serum antigen tests were positive, as was bone marrow culture. She completed a two-week course of intravenous amphotericin B while inpatient, with continued oral itraconazole for 12 months.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION: Disseminated histoplasmosis is acquired by inhaling fungal spores in endemic areas and presents with symptoms of prolonged fever, fatigue, anorexia and hepatosplenomegaly. Common laboratory findings include pancytopenia, transaminitis and hyperbilirubinemia. Typical radiologic findings include diffuse reticulonodular, interstitial, or military infiltrates, however 40–50% of immunocompromised pediatric patients with disseminated disease have negative chest x-rays. Tissue culture demonstrating typical fungal yeast forms is definitive for diagnosing histoplasmosis. Treatment with intravenous amphotericin B is given for a minimum of 2 weeks, contingent on clinical response. When clinical improvement is demonstrated, oral itraconazole is given for 12 months. \r\n\r\nTimely diagnosis of disseminated histoplasmosis can be challenging due to its heterogenous clinical presentation. This case illustrates disseminated histoplasmosis as an important differential diagnostic consideration especially in immunocompromised patients presenting with systemic illness."],

Escherichia coli is the most common cause of pyelonephritis. Enterobacter is identified in <3% of cases. Fifteen percent of women with pyelonephritis develop bacteremia. We present a case of acute pyelonephritis in a postpartum patient who developed Enterobacter bacteremia and sepsis.\r\n\r\nCASE DESCRIPTION: Previously healthy 16-year-old female presented to ED with acutely worsening back pain and fever 3 days after vaginal birth to a healthy baby. She reported back pain for several weeks but contributed it to pregnancy. On arrival, she was tachycardic, febrile and initial labs showed WBC of 17,000 and UA suggestive of infection. CXR was normal. Blood and urine cultures were obtained. IV sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim was started; a fluid bolus given. Over 24 hours, she became more ill and preliminary blood cultures were positive for gram-positive cocci. Antibiotic coverage was expanded to vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. Kidney ultrasound showed possible pyelonephritis. Urine cultures grew Enterobacter with blood cultures positive for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacter. Antibiotics were changed to cefazolin and piperacillin/tazobactam. After 48 hours, she remained tachycardic and febrile. Abdominal CT showed only kidney changes consistent with pyelonephritis. Infectious Disease was consulted and recommended meropenem and cefazolin. The next blood cultures were negative at 48 hours. Clinical improvement occurred over the next several days. She was discharged with PICC line for outpatient administration of antibiotic regimen for two more weeks. Follow-up with Infectious Disease and weekly CMP, CBC, ESR and CRP was scheduled.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION: This case of postpartum pyelonephritis was complicated in many aspects. The patient’s recent pregnancy created delay in care as back pain and UTI symptoms were easily mistaken for pregnancy/postpartum-associated pain. The UTI developed into pyelonephritis and eventually bacteremia. The initial antibiotic regimen, targeted at UTI, proved ineffective against the pyelonephritis and bacteremia. Additionally, although only one culture grew MSSA, the antibiotic course should have covered it due to high virulence and associated morbidity. \r\n\r\nMany surrounding circumstances made this a difficult case. Although recommendations are to use antibiotics targeted at the likely infection, when treating sepsis, broad spectrum coverage should not be narrowed without ruling out blood stream infection.

Treatment of MA infections is difficult as there is extensive antimicrobial resistance and no consensus among experts on one standard regimen. Agents such as amikacin, cefoxitin, clofazimine, and omadacycline have been used in the treatment of this infection.\r\n\r\nCASE DESCRIPTION: A previously healthy 15-year-old female presented for evaluation of an open midshaft fracture with visible contamination of the tibia and fibula after an ATV accident. She underwent surgical debridement and open fracture repair. Over the following two months, she had multiple readmissions for repeat debridement, and was placed on IV antibiotics for treatment of osteomyelitis due to numerous organisms. While these organisms were not recovered on subsequent intraoperative cultures, she did not have tissue healing as expected for her injury, prompting empiric expansion of therapy until acid-fast bacillus culture returned positive for M. abscessus sub. bolletii. Therapy was thus expanded to include clarithromycin and meropenem. Based on susceptibilities, the therapy was changed to amikacin, cefoxitin, and linezolid. Repeat debridements were undertaken, resulting in clearance of cultures five weeks after MA was isolated. All interim hardware was removed but an intermedullary rod was required given non-union of the tibia. Antibiotics were continued with excellent wound healing. Despite initial tolerance, after six months the patient experienced increasing serum creatinine and decreasing white blood cell count, concerning for potential amikacin and linezolid toxicities, respectively. In consultation with MA experts, the decision was made to transition to oral therapy with clofazamine, linezolid, and omadacycline. To date, laboratories are not suggestive of infection recurrence.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION: MA is a rapidly-growing NTM uncommonly encountered in healthy children; however, MA resistance to multiple agents is common. Current data does not support a single standard therapeutic regimen. Rather, the infection usually requires a prolonged courses of antimicrobials particularly in presence of hardware. This patient tolerated her initial regimen for the majority of her course, but she began to demonstrate evidence of possible nephrotoxicity and myelosuppression. Due to these abnormalities and the absence of data suggesting a clear total duration of therapy, transition to an oral regimen of clofazamine, omadacycline, and linezolid was planned. While the literature supporting clofazimine use for this indication is scant, for omadacycline it is limited to a NTM pulmonary case. This case highlights the need for study and identification of safe and efficacious NTM susceptible antibiotics."],

This paper presents findings from fourteen qualitative interviews conducted with students of architecture from eleven schools of the Nordic Baltic Academy of Architecture (NBAA) and from numerous conversations conducted with students in architecture at my home institution The Iceland University of the Arts (IUA). The findings of these conversations reveal that students consider a meaningful architectural education one that helps them making ethical design choices. To do so respondents indicate that schools should help students find their inner compass, develop their professional skills, and ethical attitudes to think independently and make a difference in their society and beyond. Four narratives emerge which describe the multiple roles of an architect in our society: the dissident intellectual, the ethical professional, the storyteller, and the carer of the world. On the basis of these findings and with the support of the work of Henry Giroux “Critical Theory and Rationality in Citizenship Education” and Martha Nussbaum “Patriotism and Cosmopolitanism”, a framework referred to as “Cosmopolitan Citizenship Architecture Education” is developed."],

      abstract: ["The architectural curriculum in Iran has been changed five times in the last five decades (1963–2017). In each period, efforts to change the content and structure of the curriculum were based on the architectural profession’s vision with regard to sociopolitical and economic issues, such as the agenda of development in the White Revolution and Islamizing the society after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The curriculum as a sociopolitical artifact can be defined as a systematic set of relations between people, objects, events, and circumstances that is changed and developed based on the sociopolitical agenda. This paper focuses on crucial moments in the transformation of architectural education between the two contemporary revolutions in Iran, the White Revolution and the Islamic Revolution. The story of the transformation of the curriculum began in 1963 when a new system of architectural education, Italian pedagogy, was brought to Iran and decolonized the curriculum from the previous pedagogy system, Beaux-Arts, and it continued until the Cultural Revolution (1980–1984), when the new Islamic government decided to detoxify the curriculum from Western influence to Islamize it. This paper outlines the transformation of the structure and content of the architecture curriculum to adapt to the sociopolitical agenda of each revolution."],

Yet our students face great societal, economic, and environmental challenges. We must ask what are we educating our students for? Do traditional models prepare our undergraduate and graduate students for a dynamic and changing world? Service-learning gets students involved in thinking in the context of real-world issues about how to address pressing community needs in partnership with community organizations. In this paper, community-engaged teaching and service-learning will be illuminated by highlighting four diverse pedagogical approaches. This paper will provide new considerations for how to integrate or advance service-learning through courses: (1) learn by designing and making; (2) learn by cross-disciplinary engagement; (3) learn by engaging in other fields and cultures; and (4) learn by serving in the pipeline."],

      abstract: ["This paper acknowledges the extent to which the majority of people who work in the field of architecture are white, examines the way that whiteness in the prevailing charity-service model of community-engaged design undermines meaningful social justice design, calls for dismantling white cultural dominance in architectural education, and outlines a pedagogical method that has shown some promise in uncovering blind spots caused by dominant culture belonging that commonly prevents architects from understanding the experiences of others during design analysis, especially where asymmetrical privilege exists, such as in the field of community-engaged design. With roots in improvisational theater tactics and a thinking framework from speculative realism that helps undermine defaulting to traditional hierarchies, these oblique pedagogical strategies appear to expand student capacity for open inquiry and self-reflection, revealing previously invisible biases, and may point to more meaningful social justice design with community. The hope is that this is an entry to providing transformative education in undergraduate architecture studios that creates unfettered creative space for students of color and productively reveals bias to white students. The concern remains that the tactic persists in centering white feelings of comfort in a way that erases BIPOC distress in the studio. Early experiments with this pedagogical approach showed promise in a fifth-year undergraduate capstone studio at Jefferson University focused on how architects (a largely privileged population) can form alliances with communities experiencing gentrification (a largely marginalized population) and again in a -second-year undergraduate studio deployed within a design fundamentals curriculum at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee School of Architecture and Urban Planning."],

      abstract: ["The impact of human activity on the global climate has started to cause physical repercussions that form, transform, and inform the natural and built environment. These repercussions have been materializing in a variety of ways, from sea level rise to wildfires, from health-threatening pollution to contamination of air, soil, and water. Architectural education in the age of climate crisis must tackle ecological challenges and respond to the impacts of global environmental change. This paper uses three curricular components as a case study to demonstrate how architectural education may be able to address global challenges through the lens of ecology, showcasing (1) Design Studios, (2) Seminar Courses, and (3) International Initiatives. This methodological approach is strongly connected to a pedagogy based on flat hierarchies, personal engagement, and collective awareness of the individuals within a course environment. The content-based pedagogy around ecology becomes a guide for both architecture and architectural pedagogy. The aim is to provide students with an understanding of how the formal relationship between the (geometric) parts of space becomes an integral part of the emerging systems within the changing environment. This paper also highlights the importance of travel components in contemporary architectural curricula, promoting a global-campus concept that is based on international academic and professional partnerships. Concrete examples of interdisciplinary and inter-university collaborations are provided to connect teaching components to research projects. The paper concludes by relating teaching and research endeavors to the current transition of traditional architecture programs to STEM-affiliated disciplines."],

      abstract: ["The idea of complexity in the teaching and practice of architectural design is linked to formal processes or their programmatic features, leaving aside relevant aspects of the complete cycle of an emergent building: the relationships with the communities involved, management of financial and material resources, technical designs, environmental qualities, construction, and performance. In this way, too much relevance is given to the production of architectural representations and the student’s individual work, in detriment to the real impact that the student's activities may have on our society. In the Clouds of Wood Design-Build Studio (Medellín, Colombia, 2013–17), complexity was understood as the passage of a team of two professors and thirty students through the stages of design and construction of small-format buildings, made in association with rural communities near Medellín and a local company specializing in building with immunized wood. Constructions with a light program, low cost, and high impact on the communities’ daily lives were agreed on between all parties. Excessive production of drawings, models, and simulations was avoided, and collaboration between students, teachers, community leaders, representatives of municipal governments, and construction instructors was encouraged. In each semester of this course (ten studios in five years), the students worked in an articulated way in five groups with defined roles and responsibilities (fund-raising, drawing, wooden models, budget, construction). They only drew plans after knowing in depth the materials and construction technologies to be implemented; they only designed after visiting the communities involved; and they only built after understanding the budgets and the various constraints in play. If in a traditional design studio the students spend at least 80 percent of their time in activities of representation, often disconnected from everyday reality, in this course, they spent half of their time in meetings with experts and leaders, generating not only a balance in favor of the project but also a limited number of precise drawings. The course ran in four one-month modules: the first one to define in a group the overall aspects of the design (program, size, location, qualities) and evaluate five variants; the second, to develop the chosen design proposal; the third, to plan the construction phase; and the last, to build and inaugurate the building with the community. The result was the creation of a family of permeable buildings that are resistant and adapted to the tropical climate; have minimal geometric, structural, and tectonic variations; and made use of the constructive advantages of immunized wood. In addition, the consolidation of a group of students committed to the particular problems of communities, who can propose necessary, relevant, and unexpected buildings, raised the question about what is significant or even radical, today, in the education of architectural design: (a) the exploration of worlds (not yet seen) through images and models, or (b) the incorporation of design into the (already existing) complex and restrictive dynamics through a built architecture project?"],

The Boston Architectural College, mission-driven to “provide excellence in design education emerging from practice and accessible to diverse communities,” sits less than a mile from these geographies. A curriculum in applied learning, where practicing and learning occurs concurrently, distinguishes the BAC’s educational approach from co-op or externship models. Its educational agenda recognizes the vital dialogue between academia and practice and locates teaching and learning directly within these conduits. This research-driven project focuses on the spatial, sociocultural geographies of Mass and Cass and examines the pedagogies of community participation and engagement in design education. The project addresses the nature of interdisciplinary teaching and learning in design settings through examining modes of critical thinking, listening, reflection, and translation as integral to civic spatial practices. Using the tools of spatial designers and conceptual frameworks from other disciplines, students attempt to understand the agents, actors, and forces at play in the conditions of Mass and Cass. Through critical inquiry into the sociocultural contexts that characterize the spatial narratives of Mass and Cass, students (and city agencies as collaborators) seek to identify moments when design or designers have, may have, or could have intervened in these contested territories."],

      abstract: ["For decades, schools of architecture have included hands-on education in their curricula in the form of design-build studios; often these studio experiences are guided by a social mission and employ participatory methods. In other cases, university community design centers provide opportunities for students to engage with community members on real-world projects. My own academic experience (which was far from unusual) involved the former, beginning with a summer studio focused on asset-based community development and participatory engagement framed within a design-build experience that launched me on a career-long path. Being confronted with a profession that conducts business as usual while academia is grooming a generation of socially responsible architects is jarring for new graduates . Today’s professionals approaching mid-career are unsatisfied with outdated business models that do not address contemporary concerns about social impact. Barriers to participatory engagement in practice include hourly billing that discourages clients from commissioning non-mandatory stakeholder engagement, as well as a culture of pro-bono work that ultimately accelerates burnout and devalues professional services. New ways of thinking require new ways of doing business. Today’s practitioners are seeking more sustainable methods of integrating the participatory strategies they employed in academia into contemporary practice. Drawing on extensive research conducted on the history of community design during my Master of Architecture, and using illustrations from my own path—from a student during the post-Katrina era to owning a community design practice—I propose strategies for challenging current models of practice. Specifically, I demonstrate how my current work with private landowners and nonprofit economic development groups incorporates participatory methods learned during my academic experience, borrowing from an interdisciplinary range of sources, including anthropology, sociology, and planning, as well as others who are disrupting the status quo of delivering creative services."],

Student research forms the basis for the Initiative’s work, which extends its reach and impact through collaboration with housing providers and policymakers. A unique process of prototype home development and versioning of the homes engages students in the research of home affordability at different points in their architectural education. Graduate students undertake a comprehensive project: designing, developing, and ultimately building a prototype home for a local client in Rural Studio’s West Alabama service area. Third-year undergraduate students then utilize those prototypes for in-depth study and development of a specific topic related to contemporary issues in housing, such as accessibility, energy performance, material research, or emerging building technologies. Faculty working through the Front Porch Initiative can synthesize that information and deliver it as products to housing providers outside of Rural Studio’s service area. Currently, student research is driven by the particular demands of creating housing in the rural communities of West Alabama. This provides students the opportunity to deeply investigate and respond to local conditions, a key component of Rural Studio’s teaching pedagogy. However, as the Front Porch Initiative continues to expand the geographic, climatic, and sociocultural footprint of the housing research, Rural Studio faces new and different challenges and opportunities presented by other localities. As the Studio moves forward, it works to better understand how the local and particular can inform a broader conversation on rural housing while educating the next generation of citizen architects."],

While most effective in the analogue world, design-build can be simulated within a classroom by leveraging virtual reality as a curriculum connecting client, spatial immersion, precedent study, construction, fabrication, and a digital design toolset. This paper and presentation will outline a course curriculum for second-year design students at the Hammons School of Architecture that leverages the pedagogy of design-build within a virtual process. The project connects specific intent for our client by crafting spatial experiences for the CHIL (Children’s Hospital Innovation Lab) Zone, a pediatric care unit of Montefiore Medical Center in New York that brings technology to their patients. Leveraging tools like AR (alternate reality), VR (virtual reality), and 3D fabrication, patients in the CHIL Zone are moved virtually beyond the confines of rooms when their medical limitations often reduce their opportunities for exploration. Approaching the process in a parallel modality to a design-build curriculum, student application happens through the construction of virtual versions of a precedent design study, including site, phasing, construction methods, details, and basic communication of the spatial concepts for their clients (kids from twelve to eighteen in a pediatric care unit). The process happens within the immersive qualities of virtual reality, creating a narrative about the architectural design that each student must communicate. Each project is resolved by finalizing a VR “docummersion” film that includes the precedent study and specific spatial elements of their own design. This process is directly generating new understandings of the design-build process. It is developing considerations of architecture and design thinking, including spatial exploration as a form of rehabilitation and health care, architectural design intended solely for use in virtual reality, and the connection of virtual reality and cognitive spatial awareness for design education."],

      abstract: ["This paper presents the project “Two Strangers Meet in a Parking Lot” and associated research studios as a case study of decolonized architecture pedagogy. The project conceptualizes the stranger as an alternative architectural user, creating a dialectical conversation with the users and architectural visions from architectural history. This dialogue encourages new pedagogical research methodologies related to the topic of city design. The case study uses these methodologies to recuperate lost cultural histories of Tennessee Town, an overlooked neighborhood in Topeka, Kansas, with an important connection to the Harlem Renaissance.  According to Kwame Anthony Appiah, strangers transgress and challenge cultural boundaries by creating conversations at the edges of these borders, yet strangers counterintuitively utilize the environments in the city that are initially foreign to them to produce alternative cultural knowledge. This interaction between stranger and entities in the city provides a model for how disciplines can communicate across their own boundaries. The strangers’ conversation, when transferred to the architectural studio setting, becomes what Mark Linder calls “transdisciplinary” discourse, which occurs at the borders of adjacent disciplines. The resulting knowledge intentionally highlights overlooked and misinterpreted cultural moments in the city while creating an alternative to traditional interdisciplinary modes of working, which the philosopher Homi Bhabha says is essential if disciplinary fields are to progress with the global city. The “Two Strangers” case study consists of built structures that were designed, first, to transform people into strangers and, then, to instigate conversations between them. As a result, strangers become acquaintances and exchange new knowledge. The architectural studio course explored this idea further by taking students outside of the classroom where they engaged with the community through conversations with city archivists, community leaders, city council persons, urban planners, and museum directors."],

Integrating a haptic and tangible process with easily recognizable social implications alongside traditional didactic models in architectural education engenders a sense of empowerment and obligation to a larger social authority. How might agency drive the education of an architect? In addition to teaching technical skills, how might academia address the methods to develop students’ skill sets working with and through local and political actors? Implemented as an experimental design-build course, the intention is to enable students to apply their understanding of the design thinking process and knowledge of architectural principles in their community. The specific course that is the case study engages students across a variety of levels outside their comfort zone through collaborating with departments, administrators, and stakeholders to truly understand the inner workings of a project at the scale of a community. The outcomes, presented through a case study of an experimental course, further exemplify how architecture students employ the concepts of environmental psychology and participatory planning in action, within the context of a semester-long design-build, to create a more integrated user-driven approach to architectural education. Leveraging the next generation of thinkers by empowering them to apply their skills for the betterment of society is critical to the future. In cultivating experiences that empower students, it is imperative to recognize each student’s ability to impact the built environment, further establishing the basis of their responsibility as a designer through developing a sense of collective agency in their design education. Therefore, not only addressing but actively pursuing engagement in the context of their education transforms their academic experience from a passive learner to an active participant."],

After visiting more than two hundred projects in more than forty cities, we have come to understand that planning, policy, and architectural design should be oriented by local communities and deep engagement with intervention sites. Of course, we are not the first to reach such a conclusion. In many ways, our work builds off contributions made by individuals, including Jane Jacobs, Kevin Lynch, and Christopher Alexander, and such movements as Team 10 and the advocacy architecture movement of the 1960s. Nevertheless, we need to broaden this significant conversation. Importantly, our classroom work has allowed us to better understand how histories often left out of such discussions can inform this new approach. To that end, we have developed community-student partnerships in underserved neighborhoods in cities like Milwaukee and Detroit. Through these connections and their related design-build projects, we have seen how the civil rights movement, immigration narratives, hip-hop culture, and alternative redevelopment histories, such as in urban agriculture, can inform the theory and practice of design. We want to bring these perspectives into dialogue with the mainstream approach to development and design. How does this look and work? Using a case study from the Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE) University Scholars Honors Program curriculum, we highlight the redevelopment of Milwaukee’s Fondy Park, an effort to create community-centered spaces and programming in an underserved African American community. Lessons include those essential for pedagogy and education, as well as for how these issues are theorized and professionally practiced, with implications for institutions, programs, and individuals."],

This essay provides a sketch for an alternative pedagogical format of integrated design research methods and studio at the graduate level, which could help bridge these perceived institutional gaps, but also offer a research agenda of its own kind. Design Research Methods is framed here as an applied theory, since exemplary design approaches themselves are selected, analyzed, comparatively discussed, and serve as a primer in the studio environment, while in turn the studio tests various theoretical concepts, design approaches, tools, and methods, and provides feedback to theory. This applied theory is not meant to replace traditional forms of critical inquiry, reading, and writing but should serve as a complementary addition that empowers students to define their own research and design agenda for their thesis year and beyond."],

      abstract: ["Innovative design solutions come from inclusive and diverse design teams (Page 2008). In this paper, I reflect on how such insights can be used in developing pedagogical approaches that use coalition building, knowledge translation between disciplines, and pedagogies of discomfort to foreground implicit biases impacting architectural practice and education. Based on interviews with educators thinking about the built environment, as well as Kevin Kumashiro’s (2002) anti-oppressive education framework and Megan Boler’s (1999) notion of a pedagogy of discomfort, and building on examples from queer and feminist educators, I suggest in this paper that the disruptive use of feelings and emotions in architectural education can prepare students for more collaborative and inclusive practices. Such discussions allow students to understand the impact of biases but also to think about tools to acknowledge and challenge inequity in the design of the built environment and in the design professions themselves. Cross-disciplinary collaboration, at both the students and the educators level, can also create opportunities for coalition building, particularly in contexts where a limited number of faculty are explicitly discussing race, gender, disability, class, sexuality, or ethnicity in their teaching. Faculty members with diverse individual self-identifications can multiply their impact by working together to tackle the intersecting ways in which minoritized experiences are pushed aside in mainstream architecture discourses and education. They can also foreground their combined experiences as positive role models to create a constructive learning environment to address these issues, both within universities and directly in the community."],

      abstract: ["In John Tabita’s essay “Doing Things Right versus Doing the Right Things,” he discusses two different approaches in the business management world: tactical thinking and strategic thinking. This opens up an interesting debate between creating the vision and implementing the vision. He offers a fair argument for both approaches. They are beneficial to tackling a problem and fundamental to success in business. Yet there is a critical tension between a tactical thinker who tends to “do things right” and a strategic thinker who is inclined to “do the right things.” “If you do something ‘right,’ but it is the wrong thing to do, your efforts will be futile. Conversely, if you do the ‘right thing,’ but you do it wrong, you will also fail miserably” (Tabita 2011, n.p.). How can we apply this inquiry to architectural pedagogy? The current model of architectural program curricula is based on the tactical approach, predominantly skill-based design education. Therefore, the measure of success in architectural pedagogy of NAAB-accredited programs tends to be solutions for tackling a design problem. While the tactical thinking process is needed and essential, how can we implement the strategic thinking process into our current architecture curricula to promote the idea of “Doing the Right Things”? The research paper is rooted in an upper-division special topics course, Data-Driven Research Methods, and will showcase two projects. The first, Spatial Network Analysis for Oklahoma City Streetcar, is focused on the infrastructure of the streetcar and its effects on the urban environment. The second project, Interactive Podium, uses embedded computing technology to create a visual platform for interaction between users. By developing diverse perspectives of the research process, the architecture curricula can nurture an effective decision-making process and proactively seek the “right things.”"],

      abstract: ["The Schools of Thought conference took place at the University of Oklahoma in Norman, Oklahoma, from March 5-7, 2020. It drew more than 100 faculty from over fifty institutions from the United States and beyond. The idea for the Schools of Thought conference grew out of research into the history of pedagogy at the University of Oklahoma (OU). In the postwar era, faculty at OU developed a truly original approach to teaching design known as the American School. Students were taught to begin with the natural context: the slope of the land, the quality of light, and the local materials. They were instructed to earnestly respond to the program and sincerely listen to the needs and desires of each client. Most importantly, students were taught to trust their own creative instincts and avoid imitation of all kinds. Their work was hard to define stylistically but united by a commitment to resourcefulness, experimental form, and respect for context. Today, we find aspects of the American School approach resurfacing in architectural pedagogy and practice. Designers are again considering how to be materially resourceful, design sustainably, and work sincerely with clients and sites. More than 70 years after the American School era was founded at OU, the “Schools of Thought” symposium sought to extend the American School tradition of reconsidering how and what we teach our students."],

      abstract: ["Students and practitioners of architecture challenge the hegemonic Whiteness, maleness, cisheteronormativity, and capitalist control of these disciplines as a means of democratizing and decolonizing practice to create conditions for Black self-determination. This paper considers how architectural professionals have responded to contemporary movements for social justice in the United States and the ways in which some are more and some less successful at addressing the intersecting nature of identity-based oppressions. Organizations and convenings, including the National Organization of Minority Architects (NOMA), Black in Design, the Design Futures Public Interest Design Student Leadership Forum, Equity by Design, and the Architecture Lobby are considered from 2012 to the pre-pandemic spring of 2020, with a focus on the emergence of new spaces and shifts in how existing spaces engage with activist movements as a result of changing political conditions. The paper provides historical background and constructive critique. It concludes with recommendations for creating institutions that respond proactively, rather than reactively, to racist violence, sexual harassment, assault, and exploitation, and for making lasting meaning of these injustices when they occur. The roles Black people and other people of color, particularly women, have played, and the roles White people, particularly men, and White institutions must play in creating an antiracist, feminist architecture are a focus of this paper."],

      abstract: ["Over the last two decades, a trend has been developing in the design community to promote social equity and emphasize the ethical responsibility of design. Community participation, programming, and post-occupancy evaluations have cemented a more democratic design process in which users, clients, and community members are given a voice to affect the final architecture product through a process called participatory design. This modus operandi becomes more vital when dealing with subcultures that historically have felt marginalized from the dominant culture. In the United States, there is great diversity among Native Americans, but our mainstream culture tends to see them as a homogeneous group, focusing on their commonalities rather than discovering and understanding individual tribal values. With the blind acceptance of generalizations about any subculture, we may miss the critical details that shape the opportunity to showcase their uniqueness and celebrate their differences. Within the studio context, what learning modalities are best to implement a participatory and constructivist learning experience? Traditionally, studio teaching with project-based design focuses on students learning formal considerations of design such as theory, environmental/structural performance, and implementation of regulatory measures. The participatory design methodology (PDM) differs in its approach by focusing on a process that emerges from all players. It does not dictate design but creates an environment that allows it to emerge through the process and interactions. The PDM process prioritizes collective synergy and creativity using participation techniques to allow for alternative solutions. In response to an inquiry by the Pawnee Native American Tribe, which invited us to investigate a proper approach to conduct design propositions within their land, this paper will report the lessons learned from the process and will exhibit alternate ways of implementing design ideas, using methodologies that expand the boundaries of academia while reaching out to native communities."],

The studio regularly collaborates with communities on urban design studies and interventions. One such project focused on the revitalization of a three-mile stretch of Route 66 running through the heart of Tulsa. Participatory action research is represented by Tulsa Photovoice, an example of how studio faculty and students collaborate with communities to discover knowledge. Working in a more traditional framework, studio students led a community-based planning process for the downtown plan of the city of Muskogee, Oklahoma, entitled a Landscape of Hope. Finally, placemaking activities like the one for the Chapman Green illustrate how students learn by making. Each case study explains how the project was initiated, what community engagement techniques were used, and how students participated. Project outcomes are also summarized."],

The findings of these conversations reveal that students consider a meaningful architectural education one that helps them make ethical design choices. To do so, respondents indicated that schools should help students find their inner compass, develop their professional skills and ethical attitudes, think independently, and make a difference in society and beyond. Four narratives emerge that describe the multiple roles of an architect in our society: the dissident intellectual, the ethical professional, the storyteller, and the caregiver of the world. Based on these findings, and with the support of the work of Henry Giroux’s “Critical Theory and Rationality in Citizenship Education” and Martha Nussbaum’s “Patriotism and Cosmopolitanism,” a framework referred to as Cosmopolitan Citizenship Architecture Education (CCAE) was developed."],

      abstract: ["This paper makes a case for the greater integration of computational logic and principles in core undergraduate architectural design courses as visual thinking pedagogy. Math and computation present abstract problems that may seem at odds with the real-world design concepts with which students are familiar. Because architecture students are typically strong visual thinkers, abstract mathematical language can be difficult to learn, but these concepts can be used as a pedagogical interface to support visual problem-solving in the design process. Building on the work of Christopher Alexander in Notes on the Synthesis of Form and A Pattern Language, the idea of “pattern languages” can be used to develop a curriculum that relies on math and computation to connect the visual and social systems at work in the design process. Design curricula can integrate computational thinking based on vector math, geometry, calculus, matrices, set theory, visual programming, and scripting to build students’ computational literacy through visual problem-solving. George Stiny’s “shape grammars” offer an intuitive analog method for introducing students to computational thinking through elements and rules in preparation for designing with digital tools. The further we distance ourselves from the fundamental operations of mathematics and computation, the more we risk becoming obsolete in the process. Computer programs can automate modeling, analyzing, programming, reviewing, and even designing buildings. For now, that places the architect in a narrow domain of design and visual aesthetics, which will quickly be subsumed by machine algorithms deployed by software companies. These machine constructions operate at the social/cultural scale, a place suited for the critical position and service of architects. The education of an architect should therefore provide students with critical knowledge and skills that position them to define the parameters of automation and challenge the computer programmers with radical ideas, communicated in a shared language of mathematics that is both visual and abstract."],

For a population that had endured a “repressive dictatorship, exploitative influence of the West, extremely uneven distribution of the wealth...and bureaucratic corruption in their workplaces,” the opportunity for a new government was appealing.

The agency is often cast as the perpetrator of heinous conspiracies perhaps conceived from the public’s imagination or the creativity of Hollywood. The tales of the organization’s involvement in assassinations, wiretapping, and eerie experiments portray the organization as rogue and powerful, acting without restraint. One particularly intriguing story details an attempt to undermine Fidel Castro’s public image by painting his shoes with a shoe polish designed to cause his trademark beard to fall out.1 This may seem like a ridiculous conspiracy theory; however, during the course of the United States Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities (often referred to as the Church Committee) this story was found to be true. The validation of such a story created suspicions in Iran about what other CIA conspiracies, especially those surrounding the 1953 Coup against Mohammed Mossadegh, were also true.2",
        "The history of U.S.-Iranian relations was greatly altered by the covert actions of the CIA during the 1953 coup that overthrew Mohammed Mossadegh. However, the most severe damage to the two countries relations was inflicted by the confirmation of this involvement during the Church Committee’s investigation into the CIA. While many in Iran may have long suspected that the U.S. government was responsible for the 1953 Coup, the final report of the Church Committee confirmed the actions of the CIA and left the Iranians wondering what else the CIA was to do.3 The revelations of the Church Committee’s final report were equally important to the history of U.S.-Iranian relations, as the covert action itself led to anti-U.S. sentiment and paranoia that fueled the storming of the U.S. embassy in Tehran and the severing of diplomatic relations between the United States and Iran after the Islamic Revolution of 1979."],

Many have debated whether these sanctions have had an actual effect on the Iranian government. While the United States originally imposed unilateral sanctions on Iran, it later collaborated with the European Union and United Nations to put multilateral sanctions on Iran with better success. But while the U.S. has been targeting the Iranian government, these sanctions have also had an impact on the Iranian citizens. While sanctions have been intended to pressure the government to stop or reduce enrichment of uranium, they have also had an impact on the population, particularly in the medical arena. Although the US allows for some exceptions to the sanctions in order to provide Iran with the necessary products for the pharmaceutical and medical industries, sanctions still have a direct impact on patients. As shown by trends in the pharmaceutical industry and by the failed Vienna Agreement in 2009, intended to discuss a fuel swap for the Tehran Research Reactor, the required treatment for about 850,000 patients went unmet.1",

Accordingly, defiance of Iran's conservative norms at the individual level is a threat to the state and must be systematically addressed in order to ensure stability; however, addressing issues of defiance in Iran is defined by a give and take relationship between the government and the people. This relationship manifests in all aspects of the Iranian experience and is most evident in the highly polarized discourse surrounding what constitutes Islamically appropriate dress for women. Upon the Islamic Revolution in 1979 under the supreme rule of Ayatollah Khomeini, Iran implemented new legislation to make veiling mandatory in public for all women in Iran, legitimized by clerics' interpretations of Sharia Law, despite women's initial widespread protests against the hardline conservative rulings thrust upon them. Due to the intrinsically linked nature of the Iranian state and its society, points of contention, such as that of the hijab and its relationship to religious authenticity, are exacerbated. Investigating the evolution of women's fashion trends in relation to the political context is indicative of the convoluted connection between the two."],

      abstract: ["Trying to pinpoint individual acts of agency within cinema can be difficult. This is especially true within Iranian cinema because agency takes different forms than viewers would assume. The term agency itself is ambiguous. It often ignores culture completely, operating on a universal Western definition that fails to encapsulate outside experiences that lead to human action. This paper seeks to explore how women are portrayed as their own agents within Iranian cinema. In order to do this, agency must be taken out of its Western context. The reason for this is that people tend to view agency through ethnocentrism, whether intentionally or not, and discount its existence in foreign works. Doing this is extremely dangerous since it marginalizes women even more by allowing the viewer to either dismiss women or to develop a savior complex, looking to rescue the “oppressed.” It also provides a justification for interference that either has no basis or functions on a lack of understanding. This paper will explore the definition of agency, provide a historical overview of women in post-revolutionary Iranian cinema, and discuss several films and the individual acts of agency within them. As I will argue, throughout its post-revolutionary history Iranian cinema has portrayed women as agents in their own right. This is especially evident in films such as Bashu the Little Stranger, Time for Love, The May Lady, and Ten. Although women are depicted as agents in these films, agency manifests itself in unique ways that stand in contrast to a Western conception of the term."],

Ramazani makes the claim that the hostility at play in foreign relations between Iran and the U.S. comes as a result of the Iran hostage crisis and the events that unfolded between 1979-1981. In 1978 Ayatollah Khomeini, an exiled Iranian Muslim leader, blamed President Carter for the “murderous regime” of Iran's leader, Mohammad Reza Shah. He argued that, in spite of claiming to support freedom, America evidently supported repression. Khomeini also spoke of the Shah as being a puppet of the U.S., which both demonized the U.S. and weakened the Shah at a time when his power was quickly dwindling in Iran. Iranians lived through the oppressive regime of the Shah for years, and the revolution came as people grew tired of the Shah and were eager to see a change in the leadership of Iran. Soon enough, protests began erupting throughout Iran in opposition to the Shah, and the revolution was underway. Khomeini and his followers vied for “freedom from American domination,” which Khomeini believed would occur as a result of the revolution. On January 16, 1979, after months of protests and with no end in sight, the Shah fled Iran, and shortly after on February 1, Ayatollah Khomeini returned from exile to lead the Islamic Revolution and create an Islamic state in Iran."],

Out of the countries in those regions, Iran is perhaps the most poorly understood of all. This ignorance extends beyond popular misunderstanding to include policy and scholarly circles. This is evident in Western discussion of ethnicities in Iran, which often results in an inaccurate understanding of the matter. While some of this misunderstanding can be attributed to faults in the West—to Orientalism, to natural hatred and misunderstanding that develop between mutual enemies, and to the inaccurate universalization of Western cultural and social paradigms—Iran's unique history certainly complicates Western perceptions and understandings."],

The body of research on these two centuries of Persian history provides us with a fairly coherent view of the status of religious minorities and their social and economic interactions with Shi'is. The focus of this work will be limited to the concept of najes, or ritual impurity, its application in Shi'a religious law, and its effect on the lives of the ahl al-kitab – People of the Book. I will argue that the application of taboos and restrictive religious laws governing interactions between the ummah and dhimmi populations was unique, or at least original, to the Safavid period, and the relationship between Muslim rulers and dhimmi populations in Iran would never again be the same. The Safavid ulama's focus on this element of Shi'a Sharia had a profound impact on the daily lives of Jews in particular, barring them from particular areas of Islamic society and placing restrictions on their behavior, dress, and economic activity. Manifestations of religious intolerance became more widespread in the advancing years of the Dynasty, which I will argue further weakened Safavid authority and contributed in part to its disintegration. The interpretation and application of religious law in avoidance of najes during the Safavid dynasty was not monolithic, and under each Safavid ruler its emphasis was different. We will explore why this concept came in or out of focus, why the Safavids were unique in their stance on the subject during their time, and how this ideology affected the populations and behavior of religious minorities at different points of Safavid rule."],

Since its inception, the Islamic Republic has recognized the power of cinema and, in turn, outsiders have recognized Iranian cinema as a window into a nation that is still shrouded in mystery. Even before the stringent codification of morals by Iran's post-revolutionary government, Iranian cinema offered a glimpse into what both the people and the Shah thought about the society that surrounded them. The Revolution of 1979 championed Iran's mostazafin, or downtrodden, and called upon the masses to lead Iran's future. But as the state began to solidify, the Islamic Republic wrote its values, both civic and moral, into its legal code. State sponsored morality is now the norm for the nation, but with roughly eighty million inhabitants, perfect adherence is not possible. The question then becomes who is best able to bypass the law? While, realistically, Iran's nouveau riche are the ones with the most wiggle room under the law, this is not an image a government for the downtrodden is interested in broadcasting. By observing Iranian cinema, one can see who can break the state sanctioned morality in both action and intent. The Islamic Republic of Iran allows for more moral ambiguity in depictions of its lower classes in cinema in order to create the appearance of giving voice to their struggle. This allowance is apparent when examining Iran's cinema leading up to the revolution, the evolution of cinema under the Islamic Republic, and the way the state allows depictions of moral relativism in modern Iranian cinema."],

The caricature looks harmless enough, until the viewer notices the signs by the door banning the atomic symbol as well as a stylized version of “Allah,” which fit right into Khamenei's (or whichever intern writes his Instagram posts) scathing caption: “Becoming global means giving in to the culture that has been imposed on the economy, politics and security of the world by a few big powers. This is the same as dependence without any difference!” The idea that globalization equates to dependence on larger Western nations is not Khamenei's own.

In early April 1980, President Jimmy Carter came to the decision that diplomatic negotiations were coming to a dead end, and the time had come to act. With this decision, Carter was faced with divisions among some of his key advisors, especially between his hawkish National Security Advisor, Zbiginiew Brzezinski, and his dovish Secretary of State, Cyrus Vance. However, the President made the final call to conduct a rescue mission to free the hostages. Unfortunately, the rescue mission, by the code name Operation Eagle Claw, came to a disastrous end in the Iranian desert. The decision to conduct Operation Eagle Claw led to the resignation of Cyrus Vance, Carter’s loss of the re-election, and the United States’ international credibility being destroyed."],

Not only did Iran-Contra tarnish the Reagan administration, traumatizing the federal bureaucracy with criminal indictments, but it also exposed “the chronic tension between America’s democratic domestic political system and its nondemocratic national security system.”1 However, its overall repercussions for Iran remain more opaque. This paper seeks to ameliorate this lopsided coverage. This paper will examine the implications of the Iran- Contra affair on U.S.-Iranian relations in response to the following inquiries: Was the ostensible U.S. goal to sustain Iranian moderates merely window dressing? Which factions actually benefited from American military largesse? Was the U.S. responsible for the later political ascendancy of the pragmatists? And how did the conduct of foreign policy proceed afterward?",
        "The Iran-Contra Affair first captured the popular imagination through Al-Shiraa’s anecdotal account of the bewildering choice of gifts the May 1986 Tehran delegation sought to woo its Iranian interlocutors with: an autographed bible and allegorical cake. According to Oliver North, the chocolate confection, which was later unceremoniously devoured by Revolutionary Guardsmen (during Ramadan nonetheless), was actually intended for the arms dealer Ghorbanifar’s mother. During the flight, a key had fallen into the icing and North opted to leave it there to conceal the dent with a deliberate looking flourish.2 This purported symbol of reconciliation succinctly describes the actual relegation of détente to an afterthought during this chain of events.",
        "To address these queries, this paper will focus solely on the eastern theatre of operations and analyze the significance of the Iran-Contra affair within a trio of contexts: its germination via initial arms transactions under Israeli auspices, the blossoming of the scandal through greater American control over project management, and the aftermath from the end of the Reagan administration through the presidency of Rafsanjani. To conclude, this paper will make suggestions to improve future diplomatic relations between the United States and Iran based on this experience."],

Traders and travelers returned with items and stories reflecting both the wealth and dissemblance of Eastern society. The introduction of the unfamiliar culture materialized not only in the collection of physical objects, but also in intellectual stimulation with an emerging societal focus on evaluating these differing traditions and customs. In their studies of the Middle East, both academics and artists attempted to capture and convey the exotic culture to Western audiences. However, the inherent power inequity implanted by colonialism sustained notions of cultural superiority in these discourses and representations. As a facet of the imperialist portrayal of the Middle East, the conception of Muslim women's role in society perfectly illustrates this imposition of hegemonic values. Influenced by larger attitudes of ethnocentrism, the depiction of Muslim women reflects a reduced, simplified, and exoticized interpretation of a complex and diverse reality. Ingrained into today's popular visual culture, these stereotypes present a challenge to the capacity of Muslim women to assert their own authority and experience, playing into a global rhetoric of division and degradation. As such, contesting the visual representation of Muslim women as subservient objects of oppression constitutes a rejection of the imperialist narrative of cultural polarization."],

While women were initially able to purchase tickets, they were barred from entering the game and left outside to watch as Syrian women were welcomed into the stadium. This treatment was due to the ongoing law in Iran that does not allow women to be present at male sports games, an attempt to protect both women and Islamic law. It is a law that is often used to criticize the apparent gender inequality in the Islamic Republic. However, shortly after the women were rejected from entering the stadium, many returned in order to protest and give a voice to themselves and the issues of gender segregation in Iran. There are various inequalities present in any government, but with some it may be more obvious, giving other nations a feeling of obligation to speak out about another government's shortcomings. However, it is essential to not focus only on the ways in which the Islamic Republic of Iran goes about suppressing women, as in doing so one would completely ignore all the ways in which women have fought over the decades to be heard, and it also overlooks the steps that the regime has taken for women in the recent years."],

We would also like to extend a sincere thank you to Professor Manata Hashemi, who in Dr. Marashi's brief absence served as an important mentor and guidance figure for the journal. It would also be remiss of us to not extend a heartfelt thank you to the Farzaneh family, for without their continued support of the Iranian Studies program none of this would be possible. The University of Oklahoma's Libraries and Printing Services are the unsung heroes of this endeavor, as without their support we would not have the ability to make DĀNESH so accessible, in both our print and digital versions. Thank you also to the tireless, diligent work of our authors, who have crafted these amazing works that we are proudly sharing with you.",

The first target was Mohammad Ali Shah, the Qajar king who had forcefully opposed constitutionalism and was responsible for the bombardment of the Majlis the year prior. After being replaced by his young son and forced to cede much of his property to the government, Mohammad Ali Shah was exiled to Russia in September. Another prominent target was Sheikh Fazollah Nuri, a senior cleric and the monarchy's chief ally among the ulama, whose shared opposition to constitutionalism earned him a swift execution in July of the same year.",

Although Nuri always kept a baseline of ideological consistency, he was someone who saw—and advocated—both sides of the issue. Therefore, he serves as a model case study."],

As is often the case, the hangings provoked condemnations from such human rights organizations as HRW, but the agitation over these hangings, and several other such cases that year, effected no marked change in policy, neither immediately nor over the course of the following years. There is a widespread Western perception of Iran as viciously anti-queer and without reservation in its anti-queerness—a reputation it continues to cultivate, one might argue, as Amnesty International's 2017-2018 report on the country concludes with “some same-sex conduct [remains] punishable by death.” However, keeping this in mind so as not to trivialize the state-sanctioned violence faced by gay Iranian men and women, this all-encompassing conclusion is short-sighted."],

Indeed, challenge stressors are believed to have net positive effects even though they can also lead to a range of strains, eliciting beliefs that managers can enhance performance outcomes by increasing the frequency of challenge stressors experienced in the workplace. The current article questions this conventional wisdom by developing theory that explains how different patterns of challenge stressor exposure influence employee outcomes. Across 2 field studies, our results supported our theory, indicating that when challenge stressors vary across time periods, they have negative indirect effects on employee performance and well-being outcomes. In contrast, when employees experience a stable pattern of challenge stressors across time periods, they have positive indirect effects on employee performance and well-being outcomes. These results, which suggest that the benefits of challenge stressors may not outweigh their costs when challenge stressors fluctuate, have important implications for theory and practice."],

Here we present new thermal history models derived from new apatite fission-track data from the footwalls of major border faults of the southern Malawi Rift and the Shire Rift. We applied apatite fission track dating to investigate the timing and magnitude of upper crustal (2-5 km; 60 -130 °C) cooling and exhumation ages associated with footwall uplift on 13 rock samples (gneisses, syenite, foliated granite, and granite dikes) collected from the footwall blocks of several major extensional border faults. Mineral separation was undertaken at Zirchron LLC, Geoscience Services using electro pulse disaggregation. The fission track mounting, calibration, and measurement were done at the University of Arizona Fission Track Laboratory. Apatite sample irradiation was carried out at the Oregon State University Radiation Center. The FT ages were measured by using the External Detector Method (EDM) with ages calculated using the zeta calibration of Hurford and Green (1983; doi:10.1016/S0009-2541(83)80026-6) using independent age standards including Durango and Fish Canyon apatite. The lengths of horizontal confined fission tracks were also measured in each of the samples to help constrain the thermal history that most-likely predicts the measured data using inverse thermal modeling software HeFTY version 1.9.3 (Ketcham, 2005; doi:10.2138/rmg.2005.58.11), the apatite FT annealing model of Ketcham et al. (2007; doi:10.2138/am.2007.2281), and Dpar (etch-pit diameter parallel to the c-axis) as an additional kinetic parameter. The timing and rate of rock uplift were further constrained through application of remote sensing fracture strain analyses. These results, when combined with our thermal history modeling results, yield cooling histories that show the border faults of the southern Malawi Rift have likely been active since the early Miocene and that this activity has caused linkage and transfer of strain to the older Shire Rift which appears to have been reactivated and accommodating strain since Pliocene."],

      abstract: ["A gas-liquid system is referred to as supersaturated when the concentration of the solute phase (gas) exceeds the equilibrium concentration in the solvent phase (liquid). A supersaturated solution can be achieved either by changing the temperature and/or pressure of the system. The gas from a supersaturated liquid escapes either through bubble nucleation that usually occurs on solid surface and/or gas diffusion through the gas-liquid interface. A pressure-driven bubble nucleation process requires a minimum threshold supersaturation to initiate the formation of gas bubble(s). In addition, a certain waiting time is required at each pressure reduction step to ensure either enough time is given for the bubbles to nucleate and grow, or to conclude that the supersaturation is not sufficient to initiate the bubble nucleation. When the supersaturation is not sufficient to cause bubble nucleation, some or all of the supersaturated gas may diffuse out from the liquid through the gas-liquid interface before the next pressure reduction step to further increase the supersaturation. In this study, a simple analytical method developed based on Fick’s second law of diffusion and Henry’s law to estimate the supersaturations generated in three gas-liquid systems (CO2-water, CH4-water, and N2-water) with two step-down pressures (100 and 500 mbar) is presented. Characteristic times of the gas-liquid systems were estimated to validate whether the waiting times used in this study are in accordance with the semi-infinite diffusion model used to estimate the supersaturations generated. During the waiting time, some or all of the supersaturated gas may diffuse out before initiating the next step-down pressure. Therefore, it is important to know the actual supersaturation in the system as a function of time during the waiting time in order to quantify the actual supersaturation required to initiate the bubble nucleation. Therefore, in this study the influence of step-down pressure, and the waiting time between the pressure reduction steps on supersaturation is also investigated."],

Even though students moved to several virtual platforms during the pandemic, it was a serious challenge to provide hands-on training to teach and train various laboratory skills. In a dry laboratory setting, the students are often facilitated with many modern and complicated devices to conduct various computational or applied mathematical analysis. The process simulation courses have become an extensive and essential tool in chemical engineering and is becoming an important part of the chemical engineering curriculum. In addition, the process simulation and computational expertise facilitate an association of research and teaching. Nevertheless, during the pandemic period, the virtual learning mode often prevents exposure to such hands-on training facilities for teaching such process simulation courses. In this article, we have discussed an online delivery mechanism to teach two AspenONE software i.e., Aspen Plus and Aspen Hysys, for CHE 2033: Introduction to Chemical Process Engineering course, which is offered to sophomores in the School of Chemical Engineering at Oklahoma State University (OSU), Stillwater, Oklahoma, USA. In addition, we discussed the experience of teaching blended online delivery mechanisms (synchronous and asynchronous) of process simulators. We believe that the experiences learned during the COVID-19 pandemic will benefit in developing novel rules, regulations, learning platforms and potential solutions for upcoming unavoidable circumstances that adversely affect the established instructional mechanisms."],

      abstract: ["Most children are spending increasing amounts of time each day using a wide range of digital media (e.g. smartphones, iPads, and laptops). However, parents and other caregivers are   often unequipped to play the roles of media mentors and family digital literacy educators, and most youth services librarians are unsure how to talk to parents about teaching good digital media use habits. The Navigating Screens project team features three nationally-recognized youth and media researchers (Willett, from The University of Wisconsin-Madison, Abbas, from The University of Oklahoma, and Agosto, from Drexel University) plus an advisory board comprised of public and school librarians, as well as influential youth and technology experts with strong ties to schools, youth groups, and other community organizations. With research and testing sites in five different U.S. public libraries in three different geographic areas, Navigating Screens gathered a rich set of data from parents and library and other professionals to learn the digital media practices within families who have children ages 5-11, and to explore how libraries and library staff guide parents in media  practices. The data set includes transcripts from interviews with parents, library staff, and community professionals.\r\n\r\nAll \"Navigating Screens\" training materials are licensed for free sharing, redistribution, and adaptation under CC BY 4.0.\r\n\r\nProject website: https://navigatingscreens.wordpress.com/"],

The data was collected from field plots in a common garden at the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture (35°53’47.84’’N, 83°57’22.86”W). The data file was created on June 1st, 2010. See attached Souza_ReadMe.rtf file for additional details.\r\n\r\nIn June of 2010, we established a common garden experiment where we manipulated genotypic diversity and soil nutrients in a completely randomized plot design. Diversity plots contained 6 individuals, one individual of 6 randomly selected genotypes. In a fully factorial design, monoculture and diversity plots were subject to one of four nutrient treatments: (1) control (no nutrient amendment), (2) nitrogen (N) amendment (10 g m-2 yr-1), (3) phosphorus (P) amendment (10 g m-2 yr-1), and (4) P and N amendment (P = 5 g m-2 yr-1and N = 5 g m-2 yr-1). We then tracked ecosystem structure (plant height, plant diameter, plant biomass, leaf area index, above-ground productivity) and ecosystem functions (net ecosystem CO2 and H20 exchange, ecosystem water use efficiency)."],

Many of the current methods of synthesizing these fluoroarenes involves selectively adding fluorines one at a time. These procedures are rudimentary and often demand long and harsh reaction conditions and often result in poor yields. Novel substrates can be reached, however, through selective hydrodefluorination or functionalization, i.e. fluorine sculpting. This research compliments recently developed chemistry which synthesizes starting material fluoroarenes in two steps by shortening the synthesis by 50%. This chemistry utilizes nucleophilic aromatic substitution to synthesize per- and poly-fluoroaryl amides in a single step under mild reaction conditions which can then be utilized for fluorine sculpting."],

Due to the researchers' inhibitors only meeting two of the criteria, we are trying to show whether these limited expectations are a valid way in identifying Hsp90 inhibitors. We think the client depletion assay test is not specific to Hsp90 inhibitors but instead is a generalized cell response to cell death.

Participants will engage in thought manipulations intended to provoke either worry or positive emotion towards several daily topics while viewing a cue for each topic. Then the visual cues for each topic will be displayed on a computer screen and an electroencephalogram will be collected to obtain the LPP Potential to assess the amount of emotional processing the participants engage in.

A distinction between arboreal and torrential species is that arboreal and semi-arboreal species rely on finger/toe pads alone to adhere, whereas torrential species utilize pads and ventral surfaces. Previous studies have focused on the relationship between morphology and adhesive efficiency, but we sought to analyze the influence of microhabitat and body size on finger/toe pad size. We hypothesized that arboreal species would have the greatest toe pad size in relation to a given body size, followed by torrential and then semi-arboreal with the smallest toe pad area. We measured the body size and toe pad area of 230 specimens, and our results supported our hypothesis. We found that microhabitat and body size have a significant effect on toe pad size."],

Individual Dictyostelium cells release chemicals into the environment, signaling nearby cells to converge into a multicellular aggregate. This allows for the formation of spores until nutrients again become readily available. Dictyostelium can be useful as a model organism for studying the various pathways through which chemotaxis, the movement of cells in response to a chemical in the cell's environment, takes place. Many of the cell signaling pathways through which chemotaxis occurs in Dictyostelium are similar to those in mammalian cells, specifically human white blood cells (leukocytes). Not only is Dictyostelium simpler and less difficult to culture than leukocytes, it is haploid, which makes mutations in target genes easier to perform than in diploid human cells. For these reasons, Dictyostelium is a useful model organism to understand the cell signaling pathway when stimulated with chemoattractants, and results gained will help provide insights into the cell signaling pathway in other cells, specifically the immune cells of humans."],

Some of these effects can be observed in species such as pinon pine (Pinus edulis), which typically have a high drought tolerance but have succumbed to widespread drought-induced mortality in recent decades, likely due to hydraulic failure. Currently, remotely sensing hydraulic failure is not possible. However, our results suggest chlorophyll fluorescence in dark-adapted samples is an indicator of water stress and the variation of chlorophyll fluorescence within a tree increases as drought stress prolongs.

Due to this lack of data, the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation (ODWC) identified A. annulatum as a species of concern in Oklahoma and funded a study to learn more about it in the state. Fall of 2018 was the first field season of this three-year study where we will be looking into the distribution, habits, habitats, and natural abundance of A. annulatum in Oklahoma. To collect specimens for this study we used drift fences with pitfall and funnel traps, visual surveys, road cruising, and dip nets at our three current sites of study, which are the Cookson Hills, Ozark Plateau, and the Nickel Preserve (Cherokee and Adair counties). In the 2018 field season, there was a total of 672 specimens captured and the specifics of the habitat where A. annulatum was captured were recorded. We will also be looking to collect environmental DNA (eDNA) samples from other potential sites to determine the presence of A. annulatum.

We seek to identify how L protein affects MreB by possibly: causing the mislocalization of MreB at specific sites of lysis, activating a section of MreB to form a hotspot for cell wall synthesis, or deactivating a section of the MreB pool, causing cell defects. To begin to determine which mechanism is correct, we will measure the localization of MreB in cells undergoing lysis to see if there is a correlation between MreB localization and L protein induced lysis. We will then examine if there is a direct interaction between L protein and MreB using biomolecular fluorescent complementation. Learning how L protein lyses cells will provide us with a better understanding of single gene lysis, which can be applied to phage therapy to kill disease causing bacteria and to effectively prevent bacteriophages from killing helpful bacteria that assist in preventing disease or are important for industrial purposes."],

      abstract: ["Daphnia lumholtzi is an example of a successful aquatic invasive species. When conditions are less favorable, D. lumholtzi switch from producing female eggs to the production of diapausing eggs (called ephippia) that are encased in chitinous shells and can form an egg bank in the sediment. Southern reservoirs do not experience extreme seasonal changes in temperature, so D.lumholtzi may rely less on resting eggs for maintaining their populations, because they can survive through most of the year compared to D. lumholtzi populations in northern reservoirs. The purpose of this study was to document the densities of ephippia from D. lumholtzi and native Daphnia in a sediment core collected from Grand Lake, OK. The D. lumholtzi ephippia were dispersed at a relatively constant rate throughout the vertical core. Daphnia lumholtzi did not appear to have a negative effect on the native Daphnia spp. based on the results that the ephippia of native Daphnia were not negatively related to the ephippia of D. lumholtzi. Future efforts should focus on spatial dynamics within reservoirs to determine how egg bank composition differs spatially, as well as, methods for identifying native Daphnia ephippia to the species level."],

      abstract: ["Freshwater communities can be complex with the predatory strategies that take place within them. Gastropods are an example of a typical prey that is found within these freshwater communities. Their predators give off a chemical cue that the gastropods can sense in the water. In doing so, these animals can enact their antipredator behaviors to avoid becoming prey. When gastropods are continuously exposed to these chemical cues, enacting these behaviors is regularly seen. Molluscs within communities without predators or with less predators use their antipredator behaviors less. Many studies have experimented to see whether these behaviors are instinctive or whether they are learned throughout their lifetime. This study asks the question if early exposure to these predator cues changes the reaction of the snail when later exposed to the same cue. The average of each group that was found below the line in behavioral trials was compared to find that the early exposure to the predator cue did not make a significant difference in exhibiting antipredator behavior when the experimental group reaction to the later cue was compared to the control group reaction. The delta akaike information criterion (delta AIC) was calculated for the following variables; test, (test*condition), (test*time), and (test*time) + (test*condition) + (test*condition). These values were calculated to show which variable or combination of variables best explained the data. It was shown that the test variable was the best variable to explain the data. The study showed that one early exposure to a predator cue does not significantly change the behavior of a gastropod."],

      abstract: ["Cardiovascular diseases are one of the leading causes of mortality in the elderly. A central role in the contraction of cardiovascular diseases by means of aging could be played by cellular senescence. Senescent cells accumulate with age in various tissues of the body including the brain. Recent studies from our lab have shown that there is increased senescent cell accumulation in the brainstem in aged mice. Neurons in the brainstem is responsible for the control of sympathetic nerve activity to several vascular beds and overactivity of the sympathetic neurons would lead to increased risk for cardiovascular diseases. It is well documented that neurons are post mitotic and do not undergo senescence, however glial cells could undergo senescence and have implications in neuronal function. In this study we developed a cell culture model to study senescence in vitro. We have used cultured human astrocytes and subjected them to oxidative stress by means of hydrogen peroxide treatment. We believe that increasing levels of hydrogen peroxide will lead to an increase in the number of senescent cells present within the cultured human brain stem astrocytes. Our results showed that there are increased levels of senescence marker p16 and senescence associated secretory phenotype IL6 upregulated after hydrogen peroxide treatment along with decreased levels of laminB1. These results suggest that we were able to induce senescence in human brainstem astrocytes and it could be used as a suitable model to study senescence in vitro. We were able to establish a model using human cells, replicating the cellular senescence in the mice and our future goal would involve understanding the mechanism by which senescence cells in the brainstem would affect the sympathetic regulation."],

      abstract: ["This paper is an expanded version of a talk given at a Generic Skills Workshop at the University of Wollongong, and was intended for academic staff from any discipline and general staff with an interest in teaching. The issues considered in the paper include the capacity of all to learn, the distinction between learning as understanding and learning as information, the interaction between the communication and content of ideas, the tension between perception and content in communication between persons, and the human functions of a love of learning. In teaching, the creation of a fear-free environment is emphasised, as is the use of analogy as a means of breaking out of one discipline and making connections with another, with mathematics and history being used as a possible example. Some of the issues raised are explored in more depth in the notes at the end of the paper, to which there are references in the main text. About the author. Rodney Nillsen studied literature, mathematics and science at the University of Tasmania. He proceeded to postgraduate study at The Flinders University of South Australia, studying mathematics under Igor Kluvánek and, through him, coming into contact with the European intellectual tradition. He held academic positions at the Royal University of Malta and the University College of Swansea, Wales. Upon returning to Australia, he took up a lecturing position at the University of Wollongong, where he continues to teach and conduct research in pure mathematics. At the University he is a member of Academic Senate and is the Chair of the Human Research Ethics Committee. He received a Doctor of Science degree from the University of Tasmania in 2000. His interests include literature, classical music and the enjoyment of nature."],

We assume that virtue can be taught in the sense that teachers can influence character development in their students and explore the challenges and opportunities of teaching virtue from a variety of perspectives.  In part I, Nancy E. Snow surveys a number of theoretical perspectives on teaching virtue which have been or are being implemented in schools.  Scott Beck, the principal of Norman High School, describes in part II the grassroots approach to character development recently initiated at his institution.  In part III we discuss how features of the Norman High initiative illus-trate aspects of the approaches discussed in part I, and conclude with general observations about roles for askesis, or disciplined practice, in changing school communities and cultivating character."],

Most of those echo familiar misgivings about the notions of character, virtue and education in virtue – as unclear, redundant, old-fashioned, religious, paternalistic, anti-democratic, conservative, individualistic, relative and situation dependent. I expose those\r\nmisgivings as ‘myths’, while at the same time acknowledging three better–founded historical, methodological and practical concerns about the notions in question."],

      abstract: ["I consider this question in light of Slote’s proposal for an ‘agent-based’ account of social justice, on which we can evaluate a society in terms of the morally virtuous motives being expressed in the ‘actions’ of laws, institutions and customs. I first motivate Slote’s project, then present two interpretations of his account: one which assesses the actual or apparently manifest motives of a sufficient number of individuals who instantiate social and political institutions, and one where social and political institutions are thought of as discrete agents which themselves express or reflect quasi-motives , aside from any particular individual’s actual or apparent motive. I argue that both of these formulations of the agent-based picture of social justice meet the same problem. For example, with regard to individuals’ motives, what would count as the good or virtuous motive qua political participant or representative can only be properly specified by prior reference to the expectations attached to particular social or political roles. Having exposed the problems in the agent-based approach, I end by considering whether and to what extent it generalizes and threatens to hamper any kind of virtue ethical project in social and political philosophy."],

      abstract: ["In this programmatic essay, I approach the question \"What is open-mindedness?\" through three more specific questions, each designed to foreground a distinct dimension along which the analysis of open-mindedness might proceed: When is open-mindedness? What is not open-mindedness? and, Where is open-mindedness? The first question refers to the temporal dimension of open-mindedness, which I analyze in terms of Dewey’s distinction between recognition and perception and the psychoanalytic concept of disavowal. The second question refers to the dialectical dimension of open-mindedness, to what the many aspects of closed-mindedness reveal about open-mindedness. Here I recall Aristotle’s doctrine of the mean. The third question refers to the dimension of scale, asking what open- and closed-mindedness look like on the interpersonal and social levels. To bring out this third dimension, I draw on Jonathan Lear's reading of the Republic and psychoanalytic group dynamics theory. Through these three related inquiries I show the range of this central intellectual virtue and bring out its connections to two central, related features of the moral life: the need for integration and the need for openness to newness and complexity."],

Much of this shift has been inspired by an Aristotelian conception of practical wisdom (phronesis) also linked by Aristotle to the development of virtue and character. This has in turn led recent educational philosophers and theorists – inspired by latter-day developments in virtue ethics and virtue epistemology – to investigate the contribution of various forms of virtue to the effective practice of teaching. In this light, the present paper undertakes further exploration of the logical geography of virtue, character and practical deliberation in teaching."],

      abstract: ["Though chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) are globally ubiquitous today, the timing, location, and manner of their domestication is contentious. Until recently, archaeologists placed the origin of the domestic chicken in northern China, perhaps as early as 8,000 years ago. Such evidence however complicates our understanding of how the chicken was domesticated because its wild progenitor – the red jungle fowl (Gallus gallus) – lives in tropical ecosystems and does not exist in northern China today or in the recent past. Increasingly, multiple lines of evidence suggest that many of the archaeological bird remains underlying this northern origins hypothesis have been misidentified. Here we analyze the mitochondrial DNA of some of the earliest purported chickens from the Dadiwan site in northern China and conclude that they are pheasants (Phasianus colchicus). Curiously, stable isotope values from the same birds reveal that their diet was heavy in agricultural products (namely millet), meaning that they lived adjacent to or among some of the earliest farming communities in East Asia. We suggest that the exploitation of these baited birds was an important adaptation for early farmers in China’s arid north, and that management practices like these likely played a role in the domestication of animals – including the chicken – in similar contexts throughout the region."],

      abstract: ["To date, characterization of ancient oral (dental calculus) and gut (coprolite) microbiota has been primarily accomplished through a metataxonomic approach involving targeted amplification of one or more variable regions in the 16S rRNA gene. Specifically, the V3 region (E. coli 341–534) of this gene has been suggested as an excellent candidate for ancient DNA amplification and microbial community reconstruction. However, in practice this metataxonomic approach often produces highly skewed taxonomic frequency data. In this study, we use non-targeted (shotgun metagenomics) sequencing methods to better understand skewed microbial profiles observed in four ancient dental calculus specimens previously analyzed by amplicon sequencing. Through comparisons of microbial taxonomic counts from paired amplicon (V3 U341F/534R) and shotgun sequencing datasets, we demonstrate that extensive length polymorphisms in the V3 region are a consistent and major cause of differential amplification leading to taxonomic bias in ancient microbiome reconstructions based on amplicon sequencing. We conclude that systematic amplification bias confounds attempts to accurately reconstruct microbiome taxonomic profiles from 16S rRNA V3 amplicon data generated using universal primers. Because in silico analysis indicates that alternative 16S rRNA hypervariable regions will present similar challenges, we advocate for the use of a shotgun metagenomics approach in ancient microbiome reconstructions."],

To identify the species of two Gold Rush-era sea turtle specimens recovered from archaeological deposits in San Francisco, California, we first analyze ancient DNA (aDNA). We then analyze carbon (δ13Ccol), nitrogen (δ15N), and hydrogen (δD) stable isotopes of bone collagen and carbon (δ13Cap) and oxygen (δ18Oap) stable isotopes of bone apatite to test if eastern Pacific sea turtle diets have changed over the past 160 years. Ancient DNA confirms that both archaeological specimens are green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas). The stable isotope values from the 19th-century specimens are statistically indistinguishable from the modern comparatives in both δ13Ccoland δ15N, suggesting that green sea turtle dietary intake has remained relatively unchanged since the 1850s. However, the values are unclear for δD and δ18Oapand require additional research."],

CrAssphage belongs to a diverse family of crAss-like bacteriophages thought to infect gut commensal bacteria belonging to Bacteroides species. However, not much is known about the biogeography of crAssphage and whether certain strains are associated with specific human populations. In this study, we screened publicly available human gut metagenomic data from 3,341 samples for the presence of crAssphage sensu stricto (NC_024711.1). We found that crAssphage prevalence is low in traditional, hunter-gatherer populations, such as the Hadza from Tanzania and Matses from Peru, as compared to industrialized, urban populations. Statistical comparisons showed no association of crAssphage prevalence with variables such as age, sex, body mass index, and health status of individuals. Phylogenetic analyses show that crAssphage strains reconstructed from the same individual over multiple time-points, cluster together. CrAssphage strains from individuals from the same study population do not always cluster together. Some evidence of clustering is seen at the level of broadly defined geographic regions, however, the relative positions of these clusters within the crAssphage phylogeny are not well-supported. We hypothesize that this lack of strong biogeographic structuring is suggestive of an expansion event within crAssphage. Using a Bayesian dating approach, we estimate that this expansion has occurred fairly recently. Overall, we determine that crAssphage presence is associated with an industrialized lifestyle and the absence of strong biogeographic structuring within global crAssphage strains is likely due to a recent population expansion within this bacteriophage."],

      abstract: ["The Columbia River and its tributaries provide essential spawning and rearing habitat for many salmonid species, including Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Chinook salmon were historically abundant throughout the basin and Native Americans in the region relied heavily on these fish for thousands of years. Following the arrival of Europeans in the 1800s, salmon in the basin experienced broad declines linked to overfishing, water diversion projects, habitat destruction, connectivity reduction, introgression with hatchery-origin fish, and hydropower development. Despite historical abundance, many native salmonids are now at risk of extinction. Research and management related to Chinook salmon is usually explored under what are termed “the four H’s”: habitat, harvest, hatcheries, and hydropower; here we explore a fifth H, history. Patterns of prehistoric and contemporary mitochondrial DNA variation from Chinook salmon were analyzed to characterize and compare population genetic diversity prior to recent alterations and, thus, elucidate a deeper history for this species. A total of 346 ancient and 366 contemporary samples were processed during this study. Species was determined for 130 of the ancient samples and control region haplotypes of 84 of these were sequenced. Diversity estimates from these 84 ancient Chinook salmon were compared to 379 contemporary samples. Our analysis provides the first direct measure of reduced genetic diversity for Chinook salmon from the ancient to the contemporary period, as measured both in direct loss of mitochondrial haplotypes and reductions in haplotype and nucleotide diversity. However, these losses do not appear equal across the basin, with higher losses of diversity in the mid-Columbia than in the Snake subbasin. The results are unexpected, as the two groups were predicted to share a common history as parts of the larger Columbia River Basin, and instead indicate that Chinook salmon in these subbasins may have divergent demographic histories."],

      abstract: ["BACKGROUND: The negative effects of poverty includes increased risks for developmental delays, low academic achievement, poor physical and mental health, and impairments from overall stress (Hair, Hanson, Wolfe, & Pollak, 2015; Evans & Schamberg, 2009), with evidence that impairments continue into adulthood (Duncan, Magnuson, Kalil, & Ziol-Guest, 2012). However, little is known about protective community factors, like mentorship, and their role in the relationship between childhood poverty, academic achievement, and overall life stress. The current study investigated the moderating effects of supportive community mentorship on the association between childhood poverty and overall stress and academic achievement in college.",
        "METHODS: Eighty-nine college students completed an online survey that included the following measures: Life Stress Scale (current), Grade Point Average (current), and Community Risk and Resilience questionnaire (retrospective childhood). Moderation analyses were conducted to examine the role of community mentorship on the relationship between childhood poverty and functioning in college, including overall levels of stress and academic achievement (GPA).",
        "RESULTS: Results indicated that high levels of mentorship during childhood were associated with higher GPAs among students who experienced low levels of poverty, and lower levels of stress for students coming from all levels of poverty.",
        "CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that supportive community mentorship may have helped prepare college students for better academic success and communication skills, as well as better coping mechanisms. Although mentorship promoted higher academic achievement for students coming from low levels of adversity, it may not be sufficient to protect against risks associated with high levels of poverty, and other protective factors should be examined."],

      abstract: ["Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is characterized by excessive and uncontrollable worry. Individuals who experience high levels of worry have unconscious attentional biases toward threatening stimuli and display a higher amount of anticipatory processing immediately prior to the onset of threat cues. The current study examined eventrelated brain potentials, particularly the stimulus-preceding negativity, to evaluate if attention to an internal source of threat, such as elevated heart rate, can act as a distraction from a subsequent external source of threat. Participants were placed into high and low worry groups and engaged in an S1/S2 task, in which 25% of S1 stimuli were designed to draw attention toward an internal threat (elevated heart rate), before exposure to either an emotional or neutral S2. Results found that those who viewed the S1 distractor heart rate cue showed less anticipatory processing for the following S2, as indexed by a less negative amplitude of the stimulus-preceding negativity. A moderately significant relationship was also found between group and cue, indicating that these results may be applicable to other populations, such as individuals with social anxiety. These findings are in line with the existing literature regarding attentional biases and anticipatory processing in anxiety disorders. Implications and limitations of the present results, as well as suggestions for future studies are discussed."],

      abstract: ["Eastern redcedar represents a modern-day challenge to Oklahoma as it has encroached approximately eight million acres of land. This conversion is detrimental to the ecological and economic value of the land, reducing ecosystem water provisioning in particular. Eastern redcedar trees consume more water such that less is available for municipal and agricultural uses as well as ecological stream flows. Currently, efforts to reduce eastern redcedar encroachment have been unsuccessful; however, studies have shown eastern redcedar biomass to be a potential ethanol feedstock for the state. The purpose of this study is to compare eastern redcedar removal and replacement with native prairie or planted switchgrass on surface runoff, sediment yield, and biomass production. More specifically, this study monitors surface runoff and sediment yield of encroached eastern redcedar, harvested eastern redcedar, cultivated switchgrass, and native prairie using experimental watersheds (5-10 acres in size). Preliminary analysis shows that removal of eastern redcedar increased water yield by 4-5 fold. Growing switchgrass produced more biomass than restoration to native prairie, but water yield did not differ between the two. Sediment concentrations from encroached eastern redcedar watersheds were higher compared to native prairie watersheds. After harvest, previously encroached watersheds initially experienced an increase in sediment yield due to soil disturbance. After switchgrass and native vegetation re-established, sediment yields declined. These results indicate that water yield and biomass production can be increased by converting eastern redcedar woodlands to switchgrass for use as dedicated biofuel feedstock."],

      abstract: ["Ecosystem services are often recognized for their importance in productivity (e.g., Nitrogen fixation) or biosphere support (Oxygen production from photosynthesis). Cultural ecosystem services (e.g., biodiversity appreciation) are no less important to human well-being but are undervalued when incremental losses go unrecognized by subsequent generations. This phenomenon referred to as generational amnesia or more commonly a shifted baseline of biodiversity understanding. The baseline serves as a control for what is considered normal in that ecosystem and what changes are measured against. Shifted baselines are especially damaging in cultures for which a connection to Nature is emphasized as a point of identity. In the United States, the forced relocation of Native Americans to Oklahoma Territory in the 19th and 20th centuries represents an extreme shifted baseline that severed important biodiversity connections in a single generation. The main purpose of this study was to quantify shifted baselines of breeding bird biodiversity for multiple Native American tribes now based in Oklahoma. The data used for this project was collected through eBird, a volunteer-based citizen science database, from fifteen different tribes who currently have jurisdictions in Oklahoma. Additionally, data from geographic regions where these tribes are originally from prior to their relocation to Oklahoma was also collected. We used beta diversity to quantify estimates of bird community difference and loss between ancestral and Oklahoma lands. Results showed eleven of the fifteen tribes experienced a community dissimilarity over 50% between their ancestral lands and Oklahoma areas. This means these tribes experienced a change in over half of the bird communities, ancestral baseline species, they encountered upon relocation to Oklahoma. This not only shows a significant shift in bird communities experienced by the tribes, but could also provide insight to other drastic shifting baselines these tribes had to endure upon their forced removal from their ancestral lands."],

      abstract: ["Our project examines the movement among conservative Christians to change the conversation around gender, sexuality, sin and love, and to even affirm LGBT identities and sometimes even same-sex marriage. Using one poignant example, we will illustrate how our research has allowed us to develop our thought around our three initial research questions. Our first question pertained to the nature of shame, and how shame is treated differently for LGBT members in conservative churches. We will discuss our latest developments in thinking about the healthy role of shame and how shame malfunctions when applied to LGBT identities and practices as if these are sins. We argue that the toxic effects of sacramental shame make the case that sexual and gender differences are not sinful. Our research addresses questions of broad social interest about what shame is, its value, and its toxic distortions. While healthy shame is the desire to preserve social bonds, and sin creates a rupture in those social bonds, treating homosexuality and transgenderness as sin attacks LGBT people’s capacity to relate to others.\r\nOur second question asked how LGBT conservative Christians overcome the violence of sacramental shame. We will discuss the ways that claiming LGBT identity helps conservative Christians to resist the sin narrative so that they can relate wholly to other people without fearing their very capacity to do so. \r\nOur third question asked what motivates heterosexual/cisgender conservative Christians to end spiritually violent practices and to love more authentically. Surpassing our original hypothesis that “relationship” in Buber’s sense was what makes the difference, we will discuss how our findings shed light on the distinction between objectifying and relational love."],

Drawing from a larger, longitudinal study of character development and life stories in adulthood, we will interview individuals and their families about virtue-relevant events in life, such as conflicts of belief (intrapersonally, interpersonally, and institutionally), virtue-focused projects and activities, and self- and family-defining memories. Narratives will be analyzed qualitatively and critically as well as quantitatively and in relation to other measures of eudaimonic and personal development. We expect that specific virtues will serve as motivational themes in personal and family stories and that these narrative themes will predict specific paths of virtuous self-development. We further expect that specific inequalities in family and social-institutional contexts will correspond to specific conflicts in the development of eudaimonic qualities in individuals’ lives."],

      abstract: ["The key issue our team will be exploring is the role played by self-control in the development and expression of virtue. In particular, we are interested in the self-regulating function of people’s self-narratives (specifically, the degree to which these narratives weave together virtue-oriented goals and identity attributes). We expect to find that highly virtue-oriented self-narratives help to generate and maintain the motivational structure necessary for virtuous character. In order to test this hypothesis, we will refine and develop measures to investigate the relationship between virtue-relevant mental states/behaviors, general capacities for self-control, and self-narratives. Having developed the requisite psychometric tools, we will then extend our research by exploring the relationship between self-control, self-narrative, and virtue cross-culturally. By comparing Americans and Brazilians, we hope to determine whether general self-control and self-narratives play a consistent and stable role in the development of virtue (or whether there are instead important cultural differences). Finally, we will rely upon recent advances made in computational linguistics to explore how people think and talk about virtue. Our goal at this final stage is two-fold: First, we want to explore the underlying semantic and syntactical structure of people’s self-narratives and the relationship between how people think and talk about self-control and how they behave. Second, we want to develop therapeutic writing tools for shaping and changing people’s self-narratives in the hopes that these changes will in turn improve self-control and facilitate virtuous behavior (in children, adolescents, and adults). In this respect, our project has a descriptive element as well as a prescriptive element."],

Yet recent theory and research in philosophy (Kristjánsson, 2010; Slaby & Stephan, 2008) and psychology (Haidt, 2008) find that affect plays a constitutional role in the self, moral judgments, and virtuous behavior. A class of affective phenomena called existential feelings has been identified as vital to self-understanding and motivation (Ratcliffe, 2008; Slaby, Paskaleva, & Stephan, 2014). The present interdisciplinary project investigates the significance of such feelings as a motivational link between the self and virtue. In five studies using cross-disciplinary, innovative methods, we will determine whether positive existential feelings support a sense of emotional connection to others that bolsters virtues of courage, humanity, and transcendence. We will further determine whether existential feelings are negatively impacted by the aging process, and whether this process can be altered to increase virtue in older adults."],

We are documenting the virtues of kindness and fairness with experience sampling, experimental, and interview methods to test 19 hypotheses.\r\nOur initial study is an experimental test of whether trait kindness predicts behavioral helping behavior. We will present the results of this study. The primary study uses experience sampling methods (ESM) to assess kind and fair behavior over a 14-day period, with four assessments per day. Each assessment contains multiple measures of behavior, motivation, self-integration, and situational variables. The ESM study will assess the “traitness” of kindness and fairness by examining consistency over time, individual differences, and the degree of integration of behavior, motivation, and self-processes. We are currently pilot testing the measures for this study. Primary sample data collection begins in June. Following this study, we will select 10 extreme cases for narrative interviews on kindness and fairness. Our final study is an experimental test of whether trait fairness predicts behavioral fairness.\r\nIn terms of timeline, we added two studies necessary to fulfill our objectives, which we will describe. We are slightly behind schedule with the ESM study, but we will complete the project on time.\r\nWe will report on our very positive experience with deep integration that is built on the long-standing relationship between the Principal Investigators. Our biggest challenge is that Professor Cokelet is leaving the University of Miami.\r\nWe have three forms of deliverables at this point. We have conducted two research workshops at the University of Miami (intensive longitudinal research and interdisciplinary research). We have a Psychology Today blog entitled “Questions of Character.” We have a national conference presentation of our kindness experiment scheduled for August, 2016."],

Contrary to our predictions, analyses performed on the data collected thus far (n = 77) suggest that participants in the self-distanced group keep significantly more money (on average, $1) for themselves, U = 933, z = 2.35. p = .019, r = .27.

These questionnaires require respondents to summarize their trait features in very broad state-ments or focus narrowly on specific behaviors. Properly understood, virtues are partly constitut-ed by appropriate motivations in response to the real-world environment and integrated with the actor’s self—features that are not accessible using the predominant research methods.\r\nOur central aim is to deepen virtue research with intensive longitudinal measurement of virtu-ous activity, which includes behavior, motivation, self-congruence, and situational factors. We will assess participants’ real-world activity four times per day over a 14-day period with respect to two pervasive virtues: fairness and kindness. We will then conduct narrative interviews with a subset of participants about virtue in their lives. We will assess motivation in three ways (goals of the activity, motivation type, and felt motivation at the moment) and the integration of the behavior with the self in three ways (self-congruence with virtue-related behavior, consistency of virtue-related behavior over time, and narrative interviews). These innovative methods will enable us to use cutting-edge psychological methods to investigate sophisticated philosophic questions about whether and how people's capacity for virtuous activity depends on their achieving self-integration - both across time and across personal contexts."],

      abstract: ["The talk will engage distinctive contributions of the virtue of humility to the communal life of L’Arche communities, and of these communities’ practices to our understanding of humility. Long-term, dedicated Assistants in L’Arche feature a remarkable and special kind of openness to other members that facilitates loving encounter consistent with Jean Vanier’s writings on Christian love. The practices in L’Arche work against vices of pride such as arrogance, conceit, snobbishness, and self-righteousness, which all derive from egoistic, atomistic barriers to spiritual communion. These barriers are shields, partitions, divides between persons, counter to the relationships that characterize life in L’Arche. While more or less expected or typical in most human relationships and human systems, there is a striking absence of these dividers in L’Arche. We propose that this absence facilitates what humility is when combined with love: an openness to perceiving and valuing self and other together, in conformity with the mind of the exemplar. The ontology, or fundamental teleological nature of the self that justifies and makes humility possible, in combination with love, is that the self is essentially self-transcendent. In particular, it is made to transcend itself “into” the other, for the sake of the other, in benevolent service. It is also that the value that the vices of pride prescribe for the self is false. We will present several empirical lines of evidence expanding on this analysis. Bayesian cognitive modeling and model selection show that senior L’Arche Assistants unite their self-valuation with their valuing of others in decisions that are both courageous and conventionally costly. Linguistic analyses show that Assistants semantically join valuation of self and other, compared to a control group that is matched for self-reported gender, empathy, prosociality, and personality. Finally, we will present preliminary neuroimaging investigations using dense array EEG to determine whether these reconfigured models of the self associate with default-mode and perceptual networks in the brain."],

The Life is a Wonder model posits that, if an expecting mother construes her coming baby as a gift, they she will attempt to “interact” with the fetus in order to welcome her or him to the social world. This “invitation to be born” comes in the form of massages that the mother carries out whenever she feels that the baby moving in her belly. In anecdotal experiences in her training sessions with expecting mothers, the Co-Investigator has found that reciprocating the baby’s movement causes the baby to continue to move, and that the more the baby moves, the more emotionally attuned she or he is during the first few years of life. Over the long term, these in-utero experiences with reciprocation are thought to build a self that is responsive, empathic, and committed to other humans. As such, this project aims to scientifically test whether it may be possible that the massage that some mothers do on their abdomens in response to their babies’ movements may drive the emergence of the moral self."],

      abstract: ["To what extent and in what way is the self unified?  How does its degree of unification lead to or stymie virtuous motivation and action?  This project investigates embodied fluency in value-directed-actions and a drive toward integrity – an alignment between our explicitly endorsed values and automatic responses or actions. Our conceptual model operationalizes integrity as the interaction between implicit associations and automaticity of virtuous actions with self-reported explicit values endorsed by the self, with embodied responses serving as a mediator between integrity and behavior. Prediction 1: If generous values are explicitly endorsed by the self, then generous values should predict deliberative giving behavior. Prediction 2: If generous values are or have become habituated and automatic in some individuals, then implicit associations should predict automatic giving behavior. Prediction 3: Embodied measures of autonomic stress responses and neural reward will assess separate aspects of acting in accord with values. In addition to testing the local associations between measurement domains, the multimodal dataset we will acquire (self-report, implicit association tests, response times, autonomic physiology, electroencephalography) will allow us to statistically test our initial working model of integrated virtue. In this presentation, we will address our progress on data acquisition as well as our progress on a collaborative theory paper. We will reflect on the development of our project from the initial proposal, through feedback from the SMV core project team, up to the present data acquisition and analysis stage and discuss specific issues - both challenging and promising -  that have cropped up in this development, as well as some broader themes for research at the interface of neuroscience and moral philosophy."],

      abstract: ["Philosophical theories of well-being are diverse and often in disagreement, but we believe progress can be made by starting from an assertion that we think all such theories can agree on—namely, that success in at least some of one’s personal projects (such as in relationships, occupation, or education) is crucial for well-being. We also believe that a useful perspective on virtue is that it reflects qualities that aid one in pursuing personal projects or in helping others to pursue theirs (taking into account possible conflicts between these two options). We marry this philosophical approach to a psychological investigation of the development of virtue and its association with well-being. We use a new theory of personality (Cybernetic Big Five Theory) to specify the psychological contents of personal projects, which we measure using Personal Projects Analysis (PPA), a method specifically designed to assess individuals’ idiosyncratic projects. We are studying 200 undergraduates assessed three times over two years, in an attempt to answer two questions. (1) What are the proximal mechanisms underlying the development of virtue? Does commitment to virtue-involving personal projects (such as friendship) make young adults more likely to develop the virtues that are related to those projects? How do culturally constrained goals (such as being a good friend) get translated into action; do these actions include the development of virtues as subgoals or higher-order goals? (2) How is virtue tied to changes in well-being? Does virtue lead to greater success in personal projects or to the adoption of more virtuous personal projects, and are these outcomes associated with greater subjective well-being? We will discuss the challenges we have faced in conceptualizing and designing the study, as well as our progress thus far."],

To explore these questions we intend to use a range of innovative psychological methods, includ-ing: causal modeling of participants’ responses, field research on patients with severe amnesia, and tools from cognitive psychology—such as increased cognitive load—to manipulate attributions of identity, We expect our studies to provide insight both into the mechanisms that lead people to define the self in terms of moral traits and into the relationships between this moral self and other important normative concepts, such as responsibility. In particular we predict that moral identification mediates attributions of responsibility, that the link between the self and identity is dependent on online cognitive processes, and that identification with some set of values increases moral motivation."],

Other causes of anemia such as warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia have an incidence of around 0.017% with a rate as high as 10% with conditions such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia or lupus. This is the case of a 65 year old female patient who presented for fatigue and dyspnea on exertion with an insidious onset. She denied bleeding from any orifices. She denied being a vegetarian and she denied any recent, unexplained weight loss. She mentioned she had a history of anemia that had never been worked up. Her past medical history also included well controlled insulin dependent type II diabetes and hypothyroidism. Patient denied smoking, drinking or illicit drug use. Her medications included insulin and Tresiba. The patient’s vital signs were stable. Physical exam was benign. No noticeable pallor. No glossitis. No tachycardia. No murmurs. No hepatosplenomegaly. Initial laboratory studies revealed pancytopenia with a WBC of 2,900/mm3, hemoglobin of 4.8 g/dL, platelet count of 101 x109/L. MCV was 110.4 fL/cell. B12 levels were also low at 146 pg/mL and methylmalonic acid levels were elevated at 18.72 nmol/L. The patient was admitted for B12 deficiency anemia with plans for transfusion of 2 units of pRBC’s for symptom control. The immunoassay for anti-intrinsic factor was negative. In trying to further understand what could be contributing to the severity of the patient’s anemia peripheral smear and hemolysis labs were performed. The peripheral smear showed hyper segmented neutrophils with macrocytic red blood cells. The absolute reticulocyte count was low at 0.13%, low haptoglobin of 8.0 mg/dL, and an elevated LDH at 5,561 U/L. This prompted a direct combs test and direct antigen test that both revealed the presence of IgG to confirm the concomitant presence of AIHA. She also had EGD done which showed atrophic gastritis with negative H. Pylori test. She was discharged home successfully with a close hematology follow up. \r\nWhile each individual cause is uncommon in the general population, the chance of both occurring is even rarer. There are few case reports of pernicious anemia and AIHA described in the literature. Transient antibody positivity for hemolysis has also been reported with pernicious anemia. Our patient did not have anti-IF antibodies which is seen in about 80-90% of cases of pernicious anemia. Atrophic gastritis can be autoimmune as well. She needs further work up for both of these entities. This case provides a unique look at a possibly non-autoimmune B12 anemia with concomitant AIHA."],

As a result, their use is becoming prevalent and a more diverse range of clinicians will encounter patients on immunotherapy and their immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Our objective is to describe a case of suspected cytokine release storm in a patient enrolled in a phase I trial on combination therapy with PDL1 inhibitor Avelumab and oral DNA PK inhibitor who was initially treated as toxic shock syndrome. \r\nCase: A 38 year-old-woman with an ependymal tumor on a phase I trial with PDL1 Inhibitor Avelumab and oral DNA PK inhibitor presented with fever and rash a few hours after receiving Avelumab infusion. On exam, vitals were Temperature 39.2 C, HR 148, BP 87/45, RR 30, Pulse Ox 98% on ambient air. Examination was significant for an alert and conversant woman with macular erythema which involved the face, upper extremities, chest, and thighs. Indwelling lines were noted: a peritoneal catheter and a PICC line. There were scattered areas of desquamation on her chest and upper extremities. She was treated with broad-spectrum antimicrobials including clindamycin but her clinical status remained unchanged after 12 hours. It was decided to start methylprednisone for a possible adverse reaction to Avelumab. Given the concern for cytokine release syndrome, she was also given a single dose of Tocilizumab 800mg. Her condition improved dramatically in the next 24 hours; she was transferred out of the ICU on Day 3 of hospitalization and discharged home on Day 7 with a prednisone taper. On a follow-up appointment, her therapy was changed to an alkylating agent.\r\nDiscussion:  We present a case of CRS induced by Avelumab which resulted in rapid improvement of the rash and hemodynamic status of the patient after Tociluzimab. Our differential diagnosis included septic shock, including toxic shock syndrome. These circumstances are likely to be encountered by clinicians who are not primarily practicing in oncology.CRS is a systemic inflammatory disease characterized by a massive release of cytokines. By increasing the activity of the immune system against cancer cells and subsequently the host’s non-cancer cells, ICIs can lead to cytokine-mediated toxicity among which IL-6 plays a key role. CRS has now also been recognized to occur with ICIs, especially PD1 and PDL1 inhibitors. To our best knowledge, seven case reports have described CRS after pembrolizumab and nivolumab; however, none have specifically described this reaction to Avelumab. Rash was described in two case reports. Notably, our case is the only one that an ICI was used for an ependymal tumor. Two of the case reports described using tocilizumab and two used Mycophenolate. Corticosteroids were used in all cases and all patients recovered. Due to the increasing use of ICIs, more clinicians need to be aware that they can trigger CRS."],

      abstract: ["Introduction: Smoking represents the leading cause of preventable disease, disability and death in the United States, disproportionately affecting lower-income populations1. Smoking cessation has been shown to reduce the associated health risks and to lead to a decrease in early mortality. Due to the significant impact of smoking on our patient population, the students at OU’s student-run, free clinic, Bedlam Clinic, decided to implement a series of Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles to address this issue. PDSA cycles are widely used for quality improvement in healthcare systems and have been shown to improve outcomes2. Our aim was to improve tobacco screening and counseling in OU Bedlam student-run clinic by 20% by June 2020.\r\n\r\nMethods: From September 2019-May 2020, teams of third-year medical students, PA students, nursing students, social work students, and faculty attendings implemented PDSA rapid improvement cycles. The goal was to increase smoking screening and cessation education above the current baseline of 49.4% by the end of the year. Each individual team created a plan, which they implemented in the clinic. The number of screenings, counseling sessions, and smoking cessations were recorded per team. The teams met bi-monthly to discuss and improve upon the plan. By the third PDSA cycle, the entire clinic agreed to implement the protocol of the team with the largest increase in tobacco screenings. The protocol chosen involved an interdisciplinary approach: the nursing student initiated the screen, the Medical/PA student provided counseling for those interested, and the social work student provided resources for those motivated to quit smoking.\r\n\r\nResults: At the first PDSA cycle, 49.4% of eligible patients at Bedlam Clinic had a tobacco screening completed, with an upper and lower confidence level of 53.6% and 45.1%. Monthly data points following the initial PDSA cycle were consistently above average. By July, 2020, after 4 PDSA cycles, the average tobacco screening rose from 49.4% to 59.8%. \r\n\r\nConclusion: Implementing a multidisciplinary, quality improvement project to increase smoking cessation screening at the OU Bedlam student-run clinic was successful. Tobacco screening at the Bedlam Clinic improved by 20.1% from its baseline. The PDSA cycles elucidated that documentation of the tobacco screening process was being recorded incorrectly in the EMR. Once this was established, we implemented a protocol ensuring that this important step was not forgotten. Specifically, nursing students documented the screening in the EMR at the beginning of the visit. This step was implemented across the entire clinic by February 2020, significantly improving tobacco screenings. This project demonstrates that a student-led, annual, QI project using simple rapid cycle improvement leads to improved patient care. These projects should continue to be implemented at the Bedlam Clinic and further expanded to the remaining OU clinics."],

      abstract: ["Case Introduction: Infective endocarditis (IE) is a relatively common, usually subacute infection involving heart valves. IE is often preceded by bacteremia in patients with prosthetic hardware, artificial heart valves, vascular access catheters, or in patients with risk factors such as intravenous drug use. Normally, IE is found during work-up for bacteremia and is best evaluated with echocardiography. Prolonged IV antibiotics are the treatment of choice unless the patient has an indication for surgery such as a large vegetation or signs acute heart failure, among others. \r\nCase Description: A 75-year-old male with a past medical history of aortic stenosis status-post bioprosthetic aortic valve (AV) replacement presented with back pain. At the time of admission, labs were notable for acute kidney injury, transaminase elevation, leukocytosis, and lactic acidosis. Subsequent blood cultures grew Enterococcus faecalis. Transthoracic echocardiography confirmed endocarditis with a mobile mass involving the tricuspid valve (TV). Transesophageal echocardiography further demonstrated a large bioprosthetic aortic valve annular abscess extending into the ascending and descending aorta. Direct visualization in the OR confirmed native TV endocarditis and an AV annular abscess eroding into the atria and left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT). He underwent AV/LVOT abscess debridement, repair of aortic root using autologous pericardium with coronary reimplantation, and TV debridement and repair. His postoperative course was complicated by ventricular tachycardia and refractory cardiogenic shock secondary to right ventricular failure. He was transferred to an outlying facility for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support, but ultimately passed away. Just two weeks prior to this aforementioned admission, the patient underwent transthoracic echocardiography for new onset atrial fibrillation which demonstrated a bioprosthetic aortic valve with normal pressure gradients and without vegetation. \r\nCase Discussion: The incidence of perivalvular abscess among patients with bioprosthetic valve endocarditis is between 30% to 40%. What makes this case interesting is not only the impressive local extent of abscess, but also the aggressive nature of the infection given negative imaging just weeks prior. This case illustrates the need for rapid identification, early initiation of treatment, and availability of post-operative mechanical support for patients with bioprosthetic valve abscess from endocarditis. \r\nRamos Tuarez FJ, Yelamanchili VS, Law MA.

      abstract: ["Introduction: Congenital lobar emphysema (CLE) is a rare congenital developmental anomaly that is characterized by hyperinflation of one or more pulmonary lobes.  Although the exact etiology of the disease is unknown, the most frequently identified cause is obstruction of the developing airway. Airway obstruction can be intrinsic or extrinsic, with the former being more common. An example of intrinsic obstruction occurs when there is bronchomalacia or absent cartilage, that creates hyperinflation.  As a result, compression atelectasis occurs to the surrounding area and can result in ventilation perfusion mismatch. The left upper lobe is the most affected, as seen in 40% to 50% of cases. This disorder has a prevalence of one out of every 20000/30000 with higher incidence in males. Patients are often diagnosed and treated in the neonatal/infant period but some cases can have a more gradual and insidious onset that require treatment years later.\r\nCase: A 55 year old male, with a hx of CLE and tobacco abuse, came to the ED with dyspnea and cough. He was in mild distress, tachypneic, and oxygen saturations were in the 70s. He had a barrel-shaped chest wall and some expiratory wheezes were noted as well. He was not on oxygen at home and did not follow up with a pulmonologist. Pt denied having any surgical intervention for his congenital malformation other than bronchoscopy as a child. CT chest with contrast showed massive bullous emphysema on the left with mass effect on the right lung and deviation of the anterior junction line by approximately 8 cm to the right. Additionally, there were airspace opacities within the left lower lobe with fluid/fluid level within some of the left-sided bullae, raising the possibility of pneumonia. He was started on Zosyn and recovered well. Cardiothoracic surgical team was consulted and they recommended left pneumonectomy. However, the patient wanted to pursue the surgery outpatient. At the time of discharge, he was hemodynamically stable, saturating above 90%, and returned to baseline. Unfortunately, he was lost to follow up. \r\nDiscussion: This case illustrates that even though the patient was mostly asymptomatic throughout his life, his lungs continued to deteriorate. It may have started in one lobe of the left lung but slowly progressed to involving the entirety of the left lung. It is essential to reinforce in patients the importance of continuous monitoring and follow up regardless of symptom status."],

      abstract: ["BACKGROUND: The study of burnout among physicians and medical trainees has become a focus of many professional societies, academic institutions, and hospital systems in recent years, given the high prevalence of burnout in these populations and its implications for poor patient outcomes. However, physician burnout, widely assessed via abbreviated versions of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), has been largely considered a monolithic, syndromic condition, neglecting multidimensional aspects of the psychometric measure. This study seeks to identify the presence of distinct burnout “clusters” among academic medical professionals and trainees based on respondents’ MBI subscores of exhaustion, cynicism, and professional inefficacy, according to the analytic framework of the MBI’s developers. \r\n\r\nMETHODS: This secondary data analysis was conducted using a large dataset from the 2019 OUSCM’s well-being survey, which included the MBI among other social construct measures. Per a new analytic approach recommended by creators of the MBI, we conducted additional cluster analysis on the dataset to better characterize our population. TwoStep cluster analysis via SPSS was utilized to analyze mean scores of the 3 MBI subscales and to understand similarities, differences, and clusters that existed within the dataset. \r\n\r\nRESULTS: A total of 272 burnout subscores were included in TwoStep Cluster analysis. Sample demographics included: mean age 39.4, 78.0% female, 75.1% white, 57.2% staff. Preliminary results of the cluster analysis indicated 4 distinct clusters, at fair cluster quality, with all 272 individuals included. Four distinct clusters were identified: 1) respondents with high subscores in both cynicism and exhaustion, 105 (38.6%); 2) respondents with high scores of exhaustion only, 62 (22.8%); 3) those with high scores of inefficacy only, 58 (21.3%); and 4) those with low scores in all areas, 47 (17.3%). \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION: The emergent four-cluster pattern is consistent with preliminary cluster analysis on burnout subscores among mental health professionals, as elicited by the psychologists who developed the MBI. This method identifies individuals who share similar patterns of burnout subscores, previously considered outliers. Identifying specific dimensions of burnout within a population provides greater understanding of how individuals experience burnout and how their environments contribute to burnout. Our sample restricted to the OUSCM limits assessment of burnout clusters among medical professionals and trainees at large. Extending cluster analysis to samples from multiple academic medical institutions would validate the identification of burnout clusters and provide evidence for the development of more precise interventions to mitigate burnout among medical providers and trainees.\r\nMedia Link: https://youtu.be/-SnGGFsZFQQ"],

      abstract: ["Introduction: Most schwannomas, other than those associated with neurofibromatosis, occur in the para-pharyngeal space often originating from Cranial nerves (CN) 9-12 or the sympathetic chain. Although cervical sympathetic chain (CSC) schwannomas are uncommon, they are known for their ability to mimic the physical and radiologic findings of carotid body tumors. Treatment is surgical resection. Post-operative complications involved with removing the CSC include Horner’s syndrome (almost inevitable) and First Bite Syndrome.  \r\nCase Description: An 80-year-old female presented with a 7-year history of an enlarging right neck mass followed serially over time with moderate growth. The patient complained of locally compressive symptoms including bilateral neck pain, dizziness, dysphagia and hoarseness. The mass was non-tender and firm with a 4-5 cm diameter oriented vertically. Flexible fiber-optic laryngoscopy revealed R vocal cord (VC) sluggishness with poor abduction. CT demonstrated the mass as measuring 3.6 x 3.5 x 4.9 cm with close adherence to the right carotid artery. Biopsy was non-diagnostic. The patient consented to mass excision and right neck dissection that was performed by an otolaryngologist and cardiovascular surgeon. The right-sided mass was free from the jugular vein, carotid artery, and CN 10. It measured 5.7 cm in the largest dimension and was attached to a nerve bundle, possibly the CSC. Histopathologic examination revealed the mass to be likely consistent with a schwannoma. \r\nOn post-operative day #1, the patient had normal tongue mobility, intact CN 7 function, slight ptosis of the right eye and symmetric pupils without miosis. Fiber-optic laryngoscopy revealed subtle right VC weakness that improved by post-operative day #5. Approximately one month later, the patient complained of discomfort in her mouth and jaw on initiating a meal. Following right parotid gland ultrasound examination, the patient was diagnosed with First Bite Syndrome. Botulinum toxin was injected within the parotid gland for symptom management.\r\nDiscussion: In First Bite Syndrome, pain in the parotid area can be severe with the first bite of food. With subsequent bites, the pain often decreases. It is currently thought this is likely due to sympathetic denervation of the parotid gland due to severing of the CSC resulting in hypersensitivity of the sympathetic receptors. A majority of these symptoms resolve over time. There is evidence that Botulinum toxin type A injection causes improvement of symptoms by inducing parasympathetic nerve paralysis of the parotid gland. This can also minimize salivation by reducing the hyper-stimulation and exaggerated myoepithelial cell contraction."],

      abstract: ["Background: The University of Oklahoma-Tulsa Internal Medicine Clinic utilizes an electronic patient portal to improve communication and help achieve the healthcare triple aim of reducing costs, enhancing patient experience, and improving health. Our prior quality improvement initiative successfully improved patient portal enrollment and utilization. Our goal for the continued project was to increase the use of secure portal messaging and decrease the patient call-to-visit ratio. The clinic averages ~1800 visits per month and receives ~3.3 calls per visit with each call averaging ~10 minutes, resulting in significant use of clinic resources. Specifically, our aim was to increase utilization of portal secure messaging (both patient to provider and patient to clinical staff) by 10% and decrease patient call-to-visit ratio by 10% by June 2020.\r\nMethods: To effect and measure changes, the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) model was used. Three PDSA cycles were planned and implemented, as well as one unexpected PDSA cycle. The monthly number of secure portal messages and patient call-to-visit ratios (total number of calls to the clinic divided by the number of visits) were measured. These data points were plotted on XmR charts to determine significant trends and averages. \r\nPDSA #1: Laminated flyers containing instructions for portal registration were placed at the check-in desk.\r\nPDSA #2: Resident physicians were educated in utilizing the portal for communication with patients.\r\nPDSA #3: Information about enrolling and portal utilization were included at the top of the clinical visit summary document.\r\nPDSA #4: The widespread medical and social effects of COVID-19 began to affect our clinic.\r\nResults: After the first three PDSA cycles, our clinic's average call-to-visit ratio decreased 14% (from 3.37 to 2.89). Patient-to-provider messaging increased 27.3% (from 86.6 to 119 messages/month) and patient-to-clinic messaging increased by 38% (from 104.8 to 170.1). Of the planned PDSA cycles, advertising with flyers appeared to have the greatest change. By March and April, COVID-19 resulted in increased messages to clinical staff and a significant increase in the call-to-visit ratio--likely from the drastic decrease of in-person clinic appointments and increased calls to the clinic. \r\nConclusion: Data prior to COVID-19 showed that portal utilization improved through education of medical staff and basic marketing approaches incorporated into the clinical workflow. COVID-19 was an industry disruptor that both demonstrated the need for enhanced clinical communication, but also affected our prior in-person PDSA cycles. Additional data regarding clinical time spent answering portal messages and effectiveness of portal communication will need to be collected.  Increased portal utilization can continue to help with improvements in healthcare cost, quality, and effectiveness--and hopefully continued PDSA cycles can aid in developing new strategies to effectively communicate with our patients during this unprecedented time."],

      abstract: ["Introduction:  Herpes simplex virus type 1 encephalitis is the most common cause of sporadic fatal encephalitis worldwide.  Typical presentation includes fever, altered mental status, focal cranial nerve deficits, and seizures.  Diagnosis is confirmed by polymerase chain reaction of CSF with very high sensitivity of 98% and specificity of 94% .Atypical symptoms include urinary and fecal incontinence, aseptic meningitis, Guillan-Barre syndrome, amnesia, Kluver-Bucy syndrome, and hypomania.  This case demonstrates syncope secondary to sinoatrial dysfunction as an atypical presenting symptom.\r\nCase Description:  A 50 year old male with a past medical history of childhood traumatic brain injury and hepatitis B on Entecavir presented to the hospital after new onset syncopal episodes.  On exam he was afebrile and tachycardic. WBC count was 14,000, , K+ 2.8, and lactate 3.7.  Antibiotics were briefly initiated but not continued due to lack of source.  Potassium was replaced and patient was preparing for discharge when another syncopal event occurred.  Telemetry showed sinus pauses greater than 10 seconds.  Electrophysiology was consulted and performed heart catheterization and pacemaker placement.  The next day he developed fever of 39.2 C, altered mental status, and seizure.  He was transferred to the ICU and started on broad spectrum antibiotics and acyclovir.  Electroencephalography showed left frontotemporal epileptogenicity and CTA and CT head were noncontributory.  Lumbar puncture had normal cytology, negative PCR for herpes and echoviruses, and negative antibodies for flaviviridae.  Acyclovir was discontinued, antiepileptic medication started, and antibiotics were changed to rule out drug fever. Fevers up to 40 degrees continued despite thorough source investigation and advanced cooling efforts.  A second lumbar puncture was competed which showed lymphocytic pleocytosis and a CT head with contrast showed a new enhancing focus of the mesial left temporal lobe.  Despite negative culture data, our clinical suspicion remained very high for herpes encephalitis so acyclovir was then restarted.  Several days later culture data from both spinal fluid samples became positive for herpes simplex 1.  His fever broke, he showed clinical improvement on antiretroviral therapy, and he was discharged home several days later in stable condition.\r\n\r\nDiscussion:  In this case, the patient presented with syncope and then developed typical findings of HSV1 encephalitis but the misleading negative HSV PCR led to disregarding the correct diagnosis.  This resulted in a delay in care until unsurmountable evidence forced a clinical diagnosis which was then later reinforced by corrected objective data.  Herpes Simplex Virus 1 has been known to precipitate encephalopathy and seizures but significant viral load causing sinoatrial conduction abnormalities is less described.  It is thought that SA node dysfunction is secondary to autonomic dysfunction in the central nervous system rather than myocardial involvement evidenced by autopsy examination.  Be aware of atypical presentations of HSV encephalitis as well as the potential for clinical and laboratory disparity in order to not miss this life-threatening illness."],

Timely post-discharge follow-up has shown to reduce preventable readmissions. Efforts should be aimed at improving coordination of follow-ups. The aim of this quality improvement project was to increase post-hospital discharge follow-up by 20% for academic primary care patients admitted to a local tertiary care hospital by June 2020. This QI project was conducted at St. John Medical Center and the OU Internal Medicine Clinic utilizing Plan-Do-Study-Act methodology (PDSA). Patients admitted to OU inpatient teams who also designated OU Internal Medicine as their PCP were included in the study. An EMR query was utilized to measure follow-ups completed within 14 days of discharge. A process map was made, showing intervention points. Gap Analysis/Scatter Diagram was used to show points of largest impact. \r\n \r\nMethods:\r\n PDSA #1: Senior residents were given access to AllScripts (the clinic EMR scheduling program) to directly schedule patient follow-up appointments within 14 days of discharge. Follow-up appointments were included in patients’ discharge paperwork. \r\n   \r\nPDSA #2: Prior to discharge, patients were screened by care managers for a follow-up home visit. If appropriate, a multidisciplinary team of providers conducted an onsite follow-up visit within 14 days of discharge. \r\n \r\nResults: After PDSA #1: Residents surveyed after the first PDSA cycle admitted feeling overwhelmed with additional tasks and inconsistently scheduled appointments in AllScripts. In addition, EMR review demonstrated a high no-show rate for patients with follow-up appointments. Due to these results, we sought alternative options. \r\n \r\nAfter PDSA #2: Three patients were visited in their homes for an onsite 14-day follow-up appointment. Unfortunately, this process was put on hold given the COVID outbreak. \r\n \r\nAt baseline, 31.6% of patients discharged from the hospital attended post-discharge follow-up visit within 14 days. This percentage declined to 29.2% after our interventions. \r\n \r\nConclusion: The low rate of hospital discharge appointments within two weeks of discharge indicates that many patients are lacking crucial follow-up care. This project found that having residents enter appointments directly into AllScripts and performing home visits within 14 days of discharge made no difference in the overall rate of successful post-discharge follow-up visits. Weaknesses of this study include but are not limited to the gap of data between July 2019 and March 2020 and the small number of home visits that were performed. This project confirms the concern that unless new approaches to significant post-discharge follow-up barriers are considered, increasing the percentage of successful follow-up appointments will remain a difficult task."],

      abstract: ["Colonoscopy is a diagnostic and therapeutic procedure performed for several indications including colorectal cancer (CRC) screening, adenoma surveillance, and investigation of gastrointestinal symptoms.  Insufflation of the colon with gas allows for adequate visualization of the mucosal tissue and advancement of the endoscope; however, it can cause pain and discomfort. Thus, the majority of colonoscopies are performed with sedation in order to mitigate discomfort and enhance the colonoscopy experience for both the patient and the endoscopist. We hypothesized that deeper levels of sedation would lead to more difficulty in maintaining insufflation. We aimed to evaluate factors associated with difficulty maintaining insufflation. \r\nMethods: We performed a prospective study of all patients who underwent outpatient colonoscopies at the Veteran Affairs Medical Center in Oklahoma City between November 2019 and March 2020. Colonoscopies were performed by gastroenterology fellows and attending gastroenterologists. Indications for colonoscopies were CRC screening, positive fecal immunochemical test, symptomatic, and adenoma surveillance. Procedures were done under Monitored Anesthesia Care (MAC) with propofol or moderate sedation with fentanyl, midazolam, and diphenhydramine. Insufflation was done with carbon dioxide. \r\nData collection involved two parts. Firstly, baseline demographic information was obtained from the electronic medical record (EMR) along with colonoscopy details including type and doses of sedatives; total number of polyps, size of polyps, and specific location in colon; and total procedure times including insertion and withdrawal. Secondly, a post-procedure questionnaire was completed by the endoscopists and recorded the bubble score, endoscopic maneuvers, and difficulty maintaining insufflation.\r\nResults: A total of 542 participants underwent colonoscopies during this period. Twelve participants were excluded from the study and 37 participants did not have completed questionnaires. We found that difficulty maintaining insufflation was reported in 129 (26%) participants compared to 364 participants where no difficulty was reported. \r\nMultivariate analysis showed that patients who had difficulty maintaining insufflation were more likely to be of an older age (P=0.003), had undergone MAC sedation (P=<0.0001), were more likely to have longer procedure times (P=.0025) and fellow involvement (P=0.0002) with the procedure. \r\nDiscussion: We observed that difficulty in maintaining insufflation during colonoscopy was reported in over one-quarter of the colonoscopies done. We found four factors associated with difficulty maintaining insufflation: use of propofol sedation, older age, fellow involvement, and longer procedural times. We could not find literature that explored maintenance of insufflation. Further investigation into these factors and their relationship with maintaining insufflation is warranted as this may improve the colonoscopy experience."],

      abstract: ["Introduction: Autoimmune Hepatitis (AIH) is an inflammatory liver disease, which without adequate diagnosis and treatment, can progress to cirrhosis. There are no distinguishing clinical features to discriminate this from other liver pathology; therefore, diagnosis is made by the presence of circulating autoantibodies, elevated serum globulin levels, and histologic examination. Initial treatment is with immunosuppression by glucocorticoid monotherapy or by combination of glucocorticoid with azathioprine. \r\nCase: We present the case of a 65-year-old female with no PMH and non-specific abdominal complaints who was found to have unexplained liver cirrhosis. There was no evidence of past or present alcohol abuse. Transaminases were greater than 10x the upper limit of normal, while IgG was greater than 3x the upper limit of normal. Viral hepatitis panel and hemochromatosis mutation gene were negative. AIH was strongly suspected due to exclusion of other etiologies. Subsequently, ELISA for filamentous actin (FA) was tested and resulted positive; however, reflex to smooth muscle antibody (SMA) was negative. Autoantibodies including antinuclear, liver/kidney microsomal, soluble liver antigen, and antimicrosomal were negative. Without adequate evidence of autoantibodies, treatment was withheld until liver histopathology confirmed Type 1 AIH (AIH-1). Prior to discharge, the patient was started on oral prednisone with plans to taper immunosuppression based on therapeutic response (i.e. transaminase levels). Unfortunately, the patient was readmitted roughly 10 days later with severe complications of cirrhosis and ultimately passed away. \r\nDiscussion: The subset of SMA with specificity for FA, SMA-T, is the prototype autoantibody correlating with AIH-1. Testing for SMA-T is done by immunofluorescence staining, which can be difficult to visualize when titers are low. FA is detected by ELISA; however, this test has not been fully standardized leading to varying cutoff values depending on assay/laboratory, as well as inability to directly correlate with immunofluorescence titers. In addition, false positive results have been reported in which FA is instead linked to SMA-V, which is seen in a variety of viral illnesses, and not SMA-T. Several factors ultimately contributed to the outcome of this case including hesitation from the patient to pursue invasive measures resulting in a postponed biopsy, and thus diagnosis. However, FA levels were significantly elevated early in the course of illness, indicating the need for standardization of FA assays, as well as correlation between assay and immunofluorescence results. Development of reliable testing for FA has the potential to provide earlier diagnosis and treatment of AIH-1 in patients where SMA titers are negative."],

      abstract: ["Introduction: Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in North America. Annually, approximately 53,000 people die of colorectal cancer, yet it is largely preventable through screening. Our quality improvement initiative was to attempt to increase colon cancer screening in United States Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) eligible patients in the OU IM clinic by 10% by April 2020. \r\nMethods: All patients seen in the OU Internal Medicine clinic were screened for eligibility of colon cancer screening using the USPSTF criteria. If the patients were found to be eligible they were offered several screening possibilities to include colonoscopy, FIT testing, and cologuard screening. The necessary means to undergo testing was then arranged for the individual patient in order to attempt to increase the amount of colon cancer screening by 10% by April 30, 2020.  Several PDSA cycles were planned but unfortunately, with the onset of the SARS- CoV2 pandemic only one was able to be implemented throughout the year. The first PDSA cycle consisted of drafting a standardized letter which was added to the clinic EMR that would allow patients to bring a guest with them via SoonerRide to their colonoscopy appointment. Lack of appropriate support to appointments had been a barrier to patient’s ability to keep their screening appointment. The clinic providers and nurses were educated on how to locate and complete the letter. \r\nResults: The patient population studied included all eligible adults for colon cancer screening, as defined by the USPSTF guidelines, at the OU Tulsa Internal Medicine clinic. Our data showed that following the implementation of the first PDSA cycle the percentage of patients out of total qualifying patients in the OU IM clinic who have documented colon cancer screening done or had reason why deferred remained at 65.1%. There were no significant increases or decreases in the total percentage. Following the onset of COVID-19 pandemic, the percentage decreased to as low as 62.7%. \r\nConclusion: There was neither a significant increase or decrease in colon cancer screening in the five months following implementation of the first PDSA cycle. However, in March 2020 the American Cancer society recommended that all routine (non-diagnostic) cancer screenings be suspended in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, screening rates decreased by 86% relative to the average before January 2020. Going forward, a focus on FIT like testing may be beneficial during these times to reduce rates of missed cancers."],

A recent study found that approximately 42% of OSU Stillwater students were food insecure and sophomores, upperclassmen, and minority students were at the highest risk. The 2020 study found the food insecure students at OSU were not utilizing the food security resources available to them. The purpose of this mixed methods study was to understand why students are not utilizing the available food security resources. The first phase was qualitative and utilized interviews with sophomores, juniors, and senior-level OSU students to identify obstacles preventing resource utilization. Randomized email lists were used for recruitment, and participation was encouraged in ethnically diverse campus organizations. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed for emerging themes. The quantitative phase was informed by the interview results, and included a social media campaign promoted throughout campus using A-Frames. This intervention utilized the social media platform Instagram to promote available resources to students. Student engagement in the intervention was measured by the number of QR scans and Instagram analytics. To measure the effectiveness of increasing resource awareness, a survey was administered to Instagram followers through a direct message. The results of the qualitative phase demonstrated a major limitation in student resource usage is a lack of awareness, and the best way to distribute information on campus was social media and A-Frames. Overall, students at OSU Stillwater are facing food insecurity but are not aware of the resources available; the use of A-frames and social media demonstrate potential to increase awareness. The long-term implication of this study is a reduced prevalence of food insecurity at OSU Stillwater's campus."],

      abstract: ["Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are focal dilations of cerebral arteries caused by the weakening of the arterial wall. The resulting changed hemodynamics can further lead to stress and growth of the site until it eventually ruptures. The morbidity and mortality of a ruptured aneurysm are high, even after treatment, with many dying within months of the occurrence or suffering from lifelong disability [1]. Previous studies have separately examined the hemodynamics, mechanical properties, or morphology of human aneurysm tissues. The present work provides quantitative data on a resected human cerebral aneurysm's mechanical, collagen fiber microstructural, and morphological characteristics. The mechanical properties of the tissue were characterized using biaxial tension and stress relaxation tests. The tissue's collagen fiber architecture and its load-dependent changes were then examined using a polarized spatial frequency domain imaging system. The microstructural components of the tissue were quantified using histological procedures. This investigation extends on our previously developed characterization framework [2] and provides additional quantitative information on human cerebral artery aneurysms. Such investigations of these properties can provide essential insight into the evolution of aneurysms and their associated rupture risk, which can ultimately improve our fundamental understanding of aneurysm growth critical for the future development of aneurysm therapeutics with improved outcomes."],

HTLV is a retrovirus of clade deltraretroviradae with two known sub-types (HTLV Type-1 and HTLV Type-2). HTLV-1 is associated with a subset of patients in development of an extremely aggressive blood cancer called Adult T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma (ATLL) but HTLV-2 is not. It is known that Tax recruits host activator and co-activator proteins to binds to the integrated viral promoter region of HTLV and rapidly activate viral gene expression. Tax coding regions vary in HTLV-1 and type-2 in the predicted transcriptional activation domain. Exploring interaction surfaces of Tax with various host proteins involved may help us understand the basic transcriptional activation mechanisms that are manipulated by the HTLV-1. To investigate this, we accumulated a library of Tax expression plasmids with the Tax wild-type and mutant coding sequences from HTLV-1. The mutants collected have been established to impair transcriptions or cytoplasmic activities of Tax and include in contrast the Tax coding sequence from HTLV-2. Once the mutants were obtained, we established a stock that can be used in the future for downstream expression, purification, and activity binding assays."],

The structure of the CCM in Synechococcus elongatus has recently been resolved, but how the complex works together in order to overcome environmental and physiological obstacles is still mostly unknown. One way cyanobacteria’s CCM works is by using CO2 uptake proteins (Cup) in cooperation with the rest of the NDH-1 complexe on the thylakoid membrane to convert CO2 in the cell to HCO3. When inorganic carbon in the environment exists mostly as CO2, and the amount of overall inorganic carbon is limited, CupA is induced, alongside its constitutively expressed paralog, (CupB). CupA and CupB possess remarkably similar functionality, differing slightly in their expression and kinetic ability. While CupB is constitutively expressed in the cell, it is shown to have substantially lower affinity for CO2. CupA’s increased affinity for CO2, compared to CupB, is particularly useful when CO2 is limited in the environment. However, these two Cup proteins possess a very intriguing, and largely unknown, relationship with each other. Previous work suggests that CupA may only work with CupB, while the reverse is not true as CupB works efficiently with or without CupA. This research is to test this hypothesis, and to better determine the relationship between these proteins. This was done by genetically modifying strains of Synechococcus sp.

        "Purpose: Annexin A2 (AnxA2), a calcium-dependent phospholipid binding protein, is overexpressed in the poorly differentiated high-grade adenocarcinomas of prostate cancer. AnxA2 exists as a monomer in the cytosol and as a heterotetrameric complex with S100A10 [(AnxA2)2-(S100A10)2] at the cell surface. Phosphorylation of AnxA2 at tyrosine 23 (pAnxA2-Y23) is an important event for the localization of AnxA2 to the cell surface. At the cell surface, AnxA2 heterotetramer complex provides binding site for tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and converts plasminogen into plasmin, which plays an important role in invasion and metastasis of cancer. The cell surface AnxA2 also plays an important role in hematopoietic stem cell localization to the marrow niche and regulates osteogenic differentiation. However, the cell surface expression of AnxA2 in prostate cancer is unknown. Therefore, in the present study, we have demonstrated the cell surface expression of AnxA2 in prostate cancer cells to delineate the mechanism of bone metastasis.",

In addition, our membrane wash experiment showed that a large amount of AnxA2 is present at the cell surface of the PC3 and DU145 cell lines. In normal prostate epithelial cells, even though the expression of total AnxA2 is comparable to PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells, membrane localization of AnxA2 is very low.",

Our overarching goal is to develop an electrically powered low-cost lightweight exoskeleton for stroke rehabilitation by expanding upon previous research showing that nylon can be utilized as an artificial muscle. Nylon fishing line and silver coated nylon were used as materials for coil production. Lines were twisted together into coils, keeping consistent contact throughout testing. Voltages were generated, while keeping tension on a coil, using a single channel function generator with frequencies of 1Hz and 2Hz, and voltages ranging from 500mV to 3V in increments of 500mV. Unexpectedly, when voltage was applied to coils no response was seen, except for an observed contracting force at one volt in each frequency. Conductive artificial muscle coils displayed contracting forces with at least one voltage level. Given that coils only responded to one volt and coil resistance did not vary significantly, we infer that the response was produced from a combination of the coils voltage and current level. Current work is focusing on developing more coils that can be tested for a wider range of voltage/current levels. Future work will focus on testing additional conductive nylon varying in resistance. This study represents an important step towards designing artificial muscles that are electrically controlled. These muscles have shown the potential to be electrically powered and controlled, giving promise to electrically powered soft exoskeletons in future work which could replace bulky motor and actuator driven robotics altogether."],

However, there are some strains that can cause a variety of diseases including urinary tract infections (UTIs). UTIs caused by E. coli are the most common type of bacterial infections seen in women and are a significant public health concern. Uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) have acquired specific virulence factors including adhesions and fimbriae, which lead to increased adherence and invasion into urinary tract cells in the host. The pathogenic mechanisms employed by UPEC that promote adhesion and invasion have yet to be fully elucidated. We propose to study the mechanisms of adherence and invasion of UPEC to host cells by generating UPEC expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP). we hypothesize that the GFP-expressing UPEC will assist in studying host-pathogen interactions. To test this hypothesis, we transformed UPEC with a GFP encoding plasmid and successfully generated fluorescent UPEC. These fluorescent UPEC were used to infect human bladder epithelial cells (5637) at increasing multiplicities of infection (MOI) to study adherence and invasion. We successfully detected and quantified adherence and invasion of the fluorescent UPEC by different methods that include fluorescent microscopy, flow cytometry, and gentamicin-based invasion assays. Thus, with the assistance of GFP-expressing UPEC, we can efficiently gain more insight on host proteins that mediate adherence and invasion of UPEC. These findings will shed more light on the different mechanisms utilized by UPEC in establishing UTIs, which will in turn lead to the development of more effective therapies for the prevention and treatment of UTIs."],

      abstract: ["Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen which poses severe health problems throughout the world. There are over 90 million new cases annually, making it the most common sexually transmitted disease in the world. Chlamydia can pose significant problems during and after infection. It is imperative to understand how Chlamydia manipulates the host cell and potentially develop future treatments. The mechanisms by which C. trachomatis alters immune response is not well understood, but recent work has identified an interaction between the chlamydial inclusion membrane protein, CT226, and the potential interacting host proteins, Flightless homologue II (FLII), Leucine Rich-Repeat Flightless-Interacting Proteins 1&2 (LRRFIP1 and LRRFIP2) and TMOD3. FLII, LRRFIP1 and LRRFIP2 are known to interact as a complex and are upstream regulators of the inflammasome. Currently, it is unknown if CT226 interacts with one or all of the interacting partners and needs the actual interaction needs investigation. My hypothesis is that CT226 will directly interact with one of the 3 potential interacting partners (LRRFIP1, LRRFIP2, and FLII) and that we will be able to detect this interaction in the bacterial two hybrid system. Current efforts have focused on cloning CT226 into PUT18 and the three host proteins (FLII, LRRFIP1 and LRRFIP2) individually into PKNT25. PUT18 and PKNT25 are the bait and prey plasmids that have been adapted for use in the bacterial two hybrid system. Once each pair of plasmids are properly transformed (each E. coli strain will have two plasmids, one carrying CT226 and one carrying the potential interacting partner), they will be screened using traditional B-galactosidase assays or cAMP assays to determine the specific interactions."],

Native American (NA) has been known to be on a higher level than the other races. This study focuses on differences in suicide rates between NA and the other races at particular age groups and different genders. Twenty years (1999-2019) of suicide data were retrieved from the CDC database. Microsoft Excel and t-test were employed for data processing and statistical analysis. The results showed that the suicide rate per 100,000 population increased 38.1% nationally with male increased 34.5% and female increased 55%. Male was 281.42% higher than female. NA was 44.48% higher than total nation in age group 10-39. In age group 40-84, US total was 81.46% higher than NA. Crossing race comparison among NA, African American (AA), Hispanic (His), Asian or Pacific Islander (AP), and White (W) showed NA and W were much higher than other races. NA showed 43.31% higher in the age group 10-34 than W. W showed 86.63% higher in the age group 35-84 than NA. NA showed 99.09% and 89.62% higher in the age group 10-64 than His and AP, respectively. AP showed 31.68% higher than NA in the age group 65-84. There was no significant difference between NA and His in the age group 65-84. NA was 94.07% higher than AA through all age groups. In summary, the suicide rate increased by about 38.10%. The suicide rates ranked as W>NA>AP>His and AA. NA was the highest one in the age group 10-34, which should bring more attention to the community for further investigation. This study provides information for suicide prevention and emphases the necessity of psychological/psychiatric services and family education for those affected age groups nationally so reduction in suicide may positively impact the populations."],

We investigated whether visible light or UVA exposure induces changes in UVB absorbance and whether increased production of phenolic compounds is responsible for the absorbance changes. We exposed two Zygnema isolates to different light treatments: high light with UVA, high light without UVA, low light with UVA, and low light without UVA. After 7 days of exposure, cells were photographed and cell lengths measured. Weighed samples were extracted in methanol. The extracts were scanned with a UV spectrophotometer to determine UVB absorbance and quantitatively tested for total phenolic compounds. Zygnema isolates exposed to high light exhibited a 296% increase in UVB absorbance which coincided with a 255% increase in total phenolic content compared to samples exposed to low light. Removing UVA at high visible light exposure resulted in decreased phenolic content for only one isolate. Cell length decreased 51% in high light treatments.

Our work aims to characterize the diversity of AF’s in the herbivorous gut on a global scale using culture independent approaches. We have collected >1,000 samples, from >50 type of animals, across 5 continents. My focus in this broader project is to examine patterns and determinants of the diversity of AF in equine alimentary tract. To this end, I extracted DNA from >100 fecal horse samples, and used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify a specific marker gene (D1/D2 LSU). High throughput sequencing was conducted, and analysis of the sequence data is currently underway. My preliminary analysis revealed a high level of AF diversity within the equine alimentary tract, as evident by the detection of > 30 different cultured and yet-uncultured AF genera in these samples. Moreover, a fraction of the sequenced obtained belong to multiple novel, hitherto undiscovered lineages, clearly indicated that the scope of AF diversity in the equine alimentary tract is much broader than previously suggested. Currently, I am attempting to identify and quantify the impact of various factors (animal feed, age, sex, location) in shaping the AF community in horses via implementing a wide range of statistical and phylogenetic approaches."],

In implementing this drone design, simulations were needed to gain a better understanding of how the drone catcher would work as well as what data could be collected from a simulated collision. The 3D modeling software Solidworks was utilized to run a realistic simulation on the movement and motion of the main drone catching gripper. In running the simulations on the gripper collisions, it was found that this software was not capable of running high speed collisions at such a high rate of speed. In order for accurate simulations to be run, numerous calculations were needed to be evaluated in the span of a few thousandths of a second. This processing power could not be run on relatively powerful computers and the simulation was run at a slower, micro-gravity emulating, rate of speed. The resulting simulation gave a better understanding of how the drone catching device could capture objects midair, as well as how the mechanism worked within an instance of a collision."],

Several studies have cited exosomes as having a role in ovarian cancer progression. Various drugs can inhibit exosome secretion in cancer cells through distinct mechanisms. Recent experiments in our laboratory identified two novel drugs called “Tumor EXosome inhibitors” (TEXi1 and TEXi2). We hypothesize that TEXi1 and TEXi2 will inhibit exosome secretion in ovarian cancer cells through mechanisms similar to known exosome inhibitors. We used two ovarian cancer cell lines (OVCAR-3 and OVCAR-4) and normal fallopian tube secretory epithelial cells (FT33). Cells were treated with solvent (DMSO), known exosome inhibitors (GW4869, Nexhinib20), Hsp70 inhibitor (MKT-077), TEXi1, or TEXi2 for 48 hours. Immunoblots were performed to evaluate expression of proteins involved in exosome biogenesis and secretion. Nanoparticle tracking analysis was used to determine if TEXi1 and/or TEXi2 treatment blocks total exosome secretion. We observed that TEXi1 and/or TEXi2 were effective in reducing exosome secretion as quantified by luciferase assay. Differential expression of several exosome markers was observed in the whole cell lysates following drug treatment. CD63 levels were reduced in exosomes following TEXi1 and TEXi2 treatment. These results were also validated using NanoSight. TEXi1 and TEXi2 inhibited exosome secretion in ovarian cancer cells, serving as potential treatment methods to prevent ovarian cancer progression. These findings can serve as further research to block ovarian cancer metastasis in vivo."],

Our overarching goal is to develop a low-cost lightweight exoskeleton for stroke rehabilitation. Researchers have developed a method to transform fishing lines into artificial muscles. The goal of this project was to manufacture muscle fibers and test their mechanical properties, specifically the maximum force they can withstand before failing. Two types of fishing line (53 and 111 N) were coiled using a hand drill and weights of 170g and 240g, respectively. We then used a tensile machine to measure the force at failure for ten fibers of each type to assess the consistency of our manufacturing method. The line rated for 53 N failed at an average force of 6 N (standard deviation: 1 N). As expected, the line rated for 111 N failed at a higher average force of 10 N (standard deviation: 2 N). One of the main results is the rather large standard deviations computed, which ideally will be minimized by a more reliable manufacturing process that will ensure constant coiling speed and line tension. We were able to manufacture muscle fibers from fishing lines and quantified the maximum amount of force they can withstand before failure. Current work focus on understanding the failure mechanisms and building a rig to ensure better manufacturing consistency. Future work will focus on testing additional potentially stronger materials and develop the system to control the fiber contraction.

Once the TP53 gene is mutated, p53 proteins not only lose their tumor suppression abilities but can also contribute to tumor growth. One-way mutant p53 can do this is by increasing iron uptake and availability by altering the regulation of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster containing proteins. Understanding such alterations are important because Fe-S cluster proteins play a role in both energy metabolism and DNA repair enzymes, which can suppress the progression and expansion of cancerous tumors. This study’s main focus was to examine how TP53 mutation status influences Fe-S cluster protein regulation, and subsequently iron homeostasis in tumor cells. First, we assessed the activity of the Fe-S containing enzymes cytosolic and mitochondrial aconitase in cell lines expressing a variety of TP53 mutations. Specifically, we will use cell lines that express the six most commonly observed TP53 mutations, which represent nearly 25% of all TP53 mutations in human cancers. We found that while aconitase activity decreased as expected following the removal of iron in cells expressing WTP53, the influence of iron chelation on aconitase activity in cells expressing mutant TP53 varied depending on the mutation type. This data strongly suggests that TP53 mutations significantly influence how the activity of Fe-S cluster enzymes is regulated. Thus, our ongoing studies are focused on investigating how TP53 mutation status influences the regulation of genes involved with Fe-S cluster biogenesis and consequently, Fe-S cluster containing protein activity."],

Progressive joint calcification is associated with sensory nerve growth, and soluble CD-14 is an activated macrophage biomarker associated with OA severity. Given that PTOA pain is related to both peripheral and central changes in the nervous system, we hypothesized that PTOA pain is more strongly correlated with circulating CD14 levels compared to joint calcification. We tested this hypothesis in lean and obese adult mice. 16-week-old male and female mice were fed either a high fat or control fat diet. At 36 weeks of age, mice were anesthetized and had a non-injury sham load or rapid compressive load applied to the knee to cause PTOA. Von Frey filament and Dynamic weight bearing tests were used to evaluate mechanical pain sensitivity before injury (baseline), and two- and four-weeks post injury. At 40 weeks of age, the mice were euthanized, and we collected knee joints and serum. We used micro-computed tomography to quantify joint calcification, and we quantified serum CD14 using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. At baseline, diet did not alter pain sensitivity. Pain sensitivity increased two weeks after both compression injury and sham loading to a similar level in lean and obese mice. We are completing the four-week post injury data analysis, and we have collected all samples to measure serum CD-14 and joint calcification. We will compare the increase in pain sensitivity to serum CD-14 concentration and joint calcification volume to test our hypothesis."],

This bacterium has a marker gene, nifH, that is part of the nitrogen-fixing enzyme. The objectives of our investigation were to assess how land management history and fertilizer treatment affected nifH gene diversity and nifH soil abundance. The goal of this study was to improve our understanding of the interaction between nitrogen fertilizer application and nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Root nodules and bulk soil samples from two fields with different land management histories were examined. Field one had a land management history of corn and was planted with a vetch cover crop organized in a randomized block design of 16 plots with four fertilizer treatments: control (no-nitrogen), low-ammonium sulfate (AS112 kg N/ha), high-ammonium sulfate (AS224 kg N/ha), and steer-manure compost (224 kg total N/ha). Field two had a land management history of small grains and was planted with a vetch cover crop organized in a block design of 16 plots without fertilizer treatments. We hypothesized that nifH diversity and nifH soil abundance would vary depending on fertilizer nitrogen composition and land history. Real-time quantitative PCR was run on DNA isolated from bulk soil samples of the 32 plots to quantify nifH soil abundance. The real-time PCR showed no significant difference between fertilizer treatments in field one, but field two (small grain history) had a significantly higher abundance than field one (corn history). This result may have occurred due to the nitrogen limiting environment in the unfertilized plots in field two. This may have led to a higher affinity for rhizobium symbiosis to create nitrogen for the plant. Future work includes analysis of Miseq Amplicon sequences from root nodule DNA to assess nifH diversity."],

Beyond the nature of the problem, scientists will be interested in either one or two additional characteristics. The first, performance, focuses in achieving an accurate solution in a fraction of the time of a sequential approach. The second is consecutive, accurate and steady time readings. In their quest for performance, some scientists forget not only that the chosen tool, in many cases a distributed-memory system, is a multi-user system, but also that its components are interconnected through a high-speed communications network to facilitate the interaction among processors. In this talk, we show why a cluster characterization is relevant, particularly for scientific kernels where multiple accurate and consecutive time readings are necessary to statistically validate a behavior. We present the characterization of two clusters by using two variants of the ping pong test. One of the clusters is a multi-user research oriented cluster, while the second is a one-user cluster with older technology."],

These fibrils may either be toxic by themselves, or act as reservoirs for smaller cytotoxic oligomers. This suggests to investigate molecules as potential therapeutics that either reduce fibril formation or increase fibril stability. One example is rat amylin, which can inhibit aggregation of human amylin, a hallmark of type 2 diabetes. We use molecular dynamics to compare the stability of various preformed aggregates, built out of either human amylin, rat amylin, or mixtures of both. We considered two types of fibril-like oligomers: a single-layer in-register conformation, and a double-layer conformation in which the first U-shaped layer consists of rat amylin and the second layer of human amylin. Our results explain the weak amyloid-inhibiting properties of rat amylin and suggest that membrane leakage due to pore formation is responsible for the toxicity of rat amylin observed in a recent experiment. Together, our results put in question the use of rat amylin or the similar FDA approved drug pramlintide as an inhibitor of human amylin aggregation. They also point to mixed human-rat amylin fibril-like oligomers as possible model-systems for studies of amyloid formation that involve cross-species transmission."],

      abstract: ["There are numerous reasons why individuals choose to start their own company; and these motives vary in strength depending on the entrepreneur. These entrepreneurial motives influence the decision making and behavior of entrepreneurs. I draw upon extant research to examine the relationship of entrepreneurs' motives and self-set goals and their influence on the new venture performance. Specifically, we examine how the strength of entrepreneurs motives positively influences the frequency with which they evaluate goal progress relevant to these motives. Furthermore, I investigate the influence that entrepreneurs' evaluation of goal progress has on their positive state affect and authentic pride, and how these individual-level variables are related to new venture performance. Results support these relationships--that is, entrepreneurial motives are positively related to evaluations of goal progress, and perceived goal progress positively influences both positive affect and authentic pride. Furthermore, authentic pride was found to be positively related to new venture performance. This study helps us understand the relationships between important individual-level variables, such as goal setting and firm level performance. Such relationships are not direct and the present research helps identify some of the mediating variables. Given the substantial volume of research that underscores the importance of self-set goals in a wide range of situations, this study helps link goal setting theory more closely to entrepreneurship research."],

      abstract: ["Simultaneous application of ultrasonic vibrations during conventional material processing is recently gaining widespread attention due to enhancement of material removal mechanism and improvement in metallurgical quality. In addition, application of the high energy ultrasonic vibrations also presents a great potential to facilitate the melt expulsion in the form of sideways melt flow and droplet ejection during the laser melting of material. Such melt expulsion is likely to improve material removal efficiency and surface quality during laser machining of materials. The efficient melt expulsion is also likely to expand the application range of continuous wave CO2 laser into processes such as laser drilling, laser atomization, laser surface texturing, and laser cutting. In this work, the ultrasonic vibration-assisted laser surface processing is proposed in which the effect of simultaneous application of ultrasonic vibration on melt expulsion characteristics during continuous wave CO2 laser surface melting of metallic alloys (AISI 316 stainless steel and Ti6Al4V) is investigated. The application of ultrasonic vibrations during laser surface processing appears to suppress the surface melting due to increasing air flow above the surface and consequent enhancement of surface convection. Moreover, the application of ultrasonic vibrations at higher laser energy densities or longer irradiation times creates well defined craters/holes having resolidified surface films. The geometric features such as hole diameter/depth and aspect ratio of the laser drilled holes are greatly influenced by ultrasonic vibration parameters (frequency and displacement), laser parameters (irradiation time and working distance) and thermo-physical properties of the substrate. The high speed camera (HSC) images of the proposed process indicate that the melt expulsion under the influence of ultrasonic vibrations initiates after the laser melted pool reaches a critical size/volume. In addition, HSC images also reveal that increasing the ultrasonic frequency from 20 kHz to 40 kHz significantly decreases the first droplet ejection time. A multi-step finite element analysis, taking into account the observations of melt expulsion from HSC images, is developed for the prediction of hole volume. Expelled droplets exhibit narrow range of particle size and good circularity which is likely to be used in powder metallurgy applications."],

This research examined differences in math achievement and spatial development when using the three different types of manipulatives: concrete, virtual, and multimodal. While the quantitative findings showed no significant difference in achievement and spatial sense, the qualitative data suggested that students who had experiences with virtual and multimodal tangram manipulatives were more likely to experiment with the shapes on the screen. They saw the objects as being less permanent. Students in the physical tangram group were less likely to move pieces once they were set in place. Students in the virtual and multimodal groups also showed more persistence when solving difficult puzzles. However, this study found that experiences with tangram manipulatives, regardless of type, provided opportunities for students to develop geometric knowledge including composition and decomposition of shapes, shape congruence, and an understanding of transformations."],

      abstract: ["The ability to prepare complex molecules has been advanced and enabled by crosscoupling reactions as exemplified by the 2010 Nobel Prize being awarded to the progenitors of palladium catalyzed cross-coupling technology. This is a powerful approach to bond formation that has been utilized in fine chemical synthesis, the agro and pharmaceutical industries, material/polymer preparation, and natural product synthesis. The problem our society is facing is that a majority of the transition and main group metals that are used in cross-coupling reactions are being depleted. The 40 year development of cross-coupling reactions has centered on precious metals (Pd, Pt, Rh, Ru, Ir, Os, & Au), in part due to their high functional group compatibility. Unfortunately, cross-couplings with precious metals is not sustainable. There is an ever growing need to develop new sustainable methods that employ earth abundant metals. The focus of this dissertation is my progress in the development of cross-coupling reactions with earth abundant 1st row transition metals. Two approaches are being pursued: 1) tandem/iterative cross couplings of titanacycles as a means to modularly form two bonds in a single reaction vessel, and 2) dual catalysis for the nickel catalyzed cross-coupling of in situ generated carbon radicals. It is shown that the titanacyclopropene has been coupled with Weinreb amides to synthesize various enones regioselectively. The work is extended to couple second electrophile (Lewus acid activated benzaldehyde) to modularly synthesize tetrasubstituted furan in moderate to good yields. At last the dual catalytic approach has been successfully utilized to couple aryl/alkyl halide with aryl/alkyl nitriles to synthesize ketones in good yields by using nickel and titanium catalyst. These synthesized enones, furans and ketones are complex building blocks valued in medicinal chemistry, library preparation, and natural product."],

      abstract: ["Children who enter school with limited literacy skills risk falling behind their peers. Early intervention could be used to remediate this issue by increasing the literacy skills of children at an early age. Early literacy skills, such as alphabet knowledge, are some of the first reading skills that children are exposed to and are often cited as necessary foundational skills for reading fluency. Drill interventions have been successfully used to teach basic academic skills to young children, but there is limited research on their use with a pre-kindergarten population. The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility and effectiveness of using drill interventions to increase the letter name knowledge of pre-kindergarten students. Sixty-six pre-kindergarten students participated in the study. Individual pre-assessments of letter name knowledge were given to all participants at the beginning of the study. Participants within each classroom were randomly assigned to one of four drill intervention conditions: incremental rehearsal, interspersal, traditional drill, or the control group. Each group, not including the control, received a letter name intervention administered via small group instruction for approximately five minutes per day, one to four times per week. Participants were individually assessed on a weekly basis to measure rate of letter name acquisition. A split-plot factorial ANOVA revealed that there was no statistically significant difference in letter knowledge between intervention and control groups. In this study, drill intervention was not effective at increasing participant letter knowledge. Several limitations, including inconsistent length of intervention sessions, absenteeism among participants, and unexpected school closure due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, negatively impacted the results of the study. While the results of the current study were not statistically significant, they provide more information on the use of drill intervention with a pre-kindergarten population. Future research in this area should focus on increasing intervention integrity and consistent scheduling while maintaining participant attention and minimizing distractions. By doing so, future studies may result in more favorable outcomes and further implications for practice for this population."],

In response to the concerns, this study examines whether a company's competitive strategy is an important factor in the VED decision, and also in the quality of VED. This study focuses on a highly polluting industry, the chemical industry, and adopts various measurement methods and econometric specifications for the examination.",
        "Findings and Conclusions: Using VED about 2004 environmental performance, this study finds that companies emphasizing investment in brand image are likely to voluntarily provide more environmental information than companies that do not emphasize this strategy. Companies emphasizing investment in R&D are likely to make more voluntary disclosures about actual environmental performance than companies that do not emphasize the strategy.",
        "This study also finds that company competitive strategies affect the association between VED and environmental performance differently. If the environmental performance measure has implications for sustainability, the association between VED and environmental performance is the same or more negative for companies emphasizing investment in brand image relative to other companies. If the environmental performance measure has implications for environmental liabilities, the association between VED and environmental performance is adjusted, so these companies' VED are less likely to relate to poor environmental performance. For companies emphasizing investment in R&D, the tendency of VED to be linked to poor environmental performance is ameliorated. The association between VED and environmental performance is stronger for R&D companies compared to other companies. This association is also stronger if the environmental performance measure has implications for sustainability than if the environmental performance measure has implications for environmental liabilities."],

      abstract: ["Rudists were widespread and locally abundant carbonate producers on the Early Cretaceous Comanche Shelf from Florida to Texas, and on Mexican atolls. As members of the Caribbean Biogeographic Province, their early ancestors emigrated from the Mediterranean Province and subsequently evolved independently. Comanchean rudists formed biostromes and bioherms on the shelf interior and at the shelf margin. Carbonate stratigraphic units of the Comanche Shelf record rudist evolution during the Barremian through the Albian ages and an established zonal scheme is expanded. This study documents new Albian rudist occurrences from the Middle-Upper Albian Fredericksburg and Washita groups in Central and West Texas. Rudists in cores at and directly behind the shelf margin southeast of Austin and San Antonio, Texas, complement the rudist zonation that is integrated with ammonites and foraminifers. These new rudist data test long-held correlations of the Edwards Group with both the Fredericksburg and Washita groups based solely on lithologies. Rudist and foraminifer biostratigraphy indicate that the Edwards Group is coeval with the Fredericksburg not the Washita Group. In West Texas sections Caprinuloidea romeri occurs at the top of the Fredericksburg Group in the Fort Terrett Formation approximately 3 meters below the iron-stained hardground subaerial exposure surface. It is overlain by the Washita Group with the ammonite Eopachydiscus marcianus Zone. Caprinuloidea romeri is also documented from the type cored section of the Person Formation in the upper part of the Edwards Group. These species allow a precise correlation of the subsurface Person Formation in Central Texas with the Ft. Terrett Formation cropping out in West Texas. This evidence together with foraminifer and ammonite zones demonstrates that the Person Formation is coeval with Fredericksburg units underlying the basal Washita sequence boundary Al Sb Wa1.

This study assessed the associations between the WHO infant and young child feeding (IYCF) indicators and stunting and identified determinants of inappropriate child feeding practices.",
        "Methods: The most recent Demographic and Health Survey was used including a total of 1956 infants aged 0–23 months. Logistic regressions were performed for the association between IYCF indicators and stunting and for the determination of risk factors for inappropriate feeding practices.",
        "Results: The rates of initiation of breastfeeding within one hour after birth (77.2%), continued breastfeeding at one year (99.6%) and timely introduction of solid, semi-solid or soft foods at 6–8 months (88.3%) were high. Exclusive breastfeeding under 6 months (48.8%), attaining minimum dietary diversity (22.2%) and consumption of iron-rich foods (19.6%) were relatively low. Higher length-for-age was associated with achieving minimum dietary diversity (p<0.01). The other indicators assessed (early initiation of breastfeeding, exclusive breastfeeding under 6 months, timely introduction of complementary foods and consumption of iron-rich foods) were not associated with stunting. Infants born to mothers who had first given birth at an age younger than 19 were more likely not to be breastfed within one hour after birth, not to be exclusively breastfed and not to have the recommended dietary diversity. Infants whose mothers had low media exposure were at increased risk of being inappropriately fed. Low household wealth also was associated with higher odds of not meeting the minimum dietary diversity.",
        "Conclusions: Despite almost total continued breastfeeding at one year and early initiation of breastfeeding by more than three-quarter of mothers, minimum dietary diversity scores were still low, confirming the need for more effective programs for improving child feeding practices in Madagascar. Improving dietary diversity in children aged 6–23 months may help reduce stunting. The identified risk factors for inappropriate feeding practices could be used in directing future nutrition sensitive interventions."],

Three TCel enzymes preferentially hydrolyzed soluble cellulose, while two preferred insoluble cellulose such as cotton linters and filter paper. TCel enzymes had temperature optima ranging from 85°C to 102°C. TCel enzymes were stable, retaining 80% of initial activity after 120 h at 85°C. Two modes of cellulose breakdown, i.e., with endo- and exo-acting glucanases, were detected, and with two-enzyme combinations at 85°C, synergistic cellulase activity was observed for some enzyme combinations."],

The expression of ER subtypes, ERa and ERB, were evaluated by Western blotting and real-time RT-PCR. The subcellular distribution of ERa and ERB was further determined in nuclear and cytoplasmic tissue lysates along with the expression of inflammatory [activated NF-KB and IKB-kinase (IKK)] and oncogenic (cyclin D1) markers by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. The expression of ERa and ERB was correlated with the expression of activated NF-KB, activated IKK and cyclin D1 by Spearman's correlation.",
        "RESULTS: Both ER subtypes were expressed in normal livers but male livers showed significantly higher expression of ERa than females (P < 0.05). We observed significantly higher mRNA expression of ERa in HCV-related HCC liver tissues as compared to normals (P < 0.05) and ERB in livers of HCV-related cirrhosis and HCV-related HCC subjects (P < 0.05). At the protein level, there was a significantly higher expression of nuclear ERa in livers of HCV-related HCC patients and nuclear ERB in HCV-related cirrhosis patients as compared to normals (P < 0.05). Furthermore, we observed a significantly higher expression of phosphorylated NF-KB and cyclin D1 in diseased livers (P < 0.05). There was a positive correlation between the expression of nuclear ER subtypes and nuclear cyclin D1 and a negative correlation between cytoplasmic ER subtypes and cytoplasmic phosphorylated IKK in HCV-related HCC livers. These findings suggest that dysregulated expression of ER subtypes following chronic HCV-infection may contribute to the progression of HCV-related cirrhosis to HCV-related HCC.",

A recent implicit solvent model, IS-SPA, based on approximating the mean solvent force using the superposition approximation, provides a platform to achieve these goals. IS-SPA was originally developed to handle non-polar solutes in the TIP3P water model but can be extended to accurately treat polar solutes in other polar solvents. In this manuscript, we demonstrate how to adapt IS-SPA to include the treatment of solvent orientation and long ranged electrostatics in a solvent of chloroform. The orientation of chloroform is approximated as that of an ideal dipole aligned in a mean electrostatic field. The solvent–solute force is then considered as an averaged radially symmetric Lennard-Jones component and a multipole expansion of the electrostatic component through the octupole term. Parameters for the model include atom-based solvent density and mean electric field functions that are fit from explicit solvent simulations of independent atoms or molecules. Using these parameters, IS-SPA accounts for asymmetry of charge solvation and reproduces the explicit solvent potential of mean force of dimerization of two oppositely charged Lennard-Jones spheres with high fidelity. Additionally, the model more accurately captures the effect of explicit solvent on the monomer and dimer configurations of alanine dipeptide in chloroform than a generalized Born or constant density dielectric model. The current version of the algorithm is expected to outperform explicit solvent simulations for aggregation of small peptides at concentrations below 150 mM, well above the typical experimental concentrations for these materials."],

Observed change in the transmission amplitude is attributed to the change in the amount of destructive interference between the resonators in the vicinity of strong near field coupling. We employ a two-particle model to theoretically study the influence of the coupling between bright and quasi-dark modes on the transmission properties of the system and we find an excellent agreement with our observed results.

Unlike human health vaccination decisions where beliefs regarding adverse, personal health effects factor heavily into perceived risk, decisions for animal vaccination focus disproportionately on dynamic risks to animal productivity. We extended a commonly used stated preference survey methodology, willingness to pay, to elicit responses for a routine vaccination strategy applied biannually and an emergency strategy applied in reaction to spatially variable, hypothetical outbreaks. Our results show that households place a higher value on vaccination as perceived risk and household capacity to cope with resource constraints increase, but that the episodic and unpredictable spatial and temporal spread of FMD contributes to increased levels of uncertainty regarding the benefit of vaccination. In addition, concerns regarding the performance of the vaccine underlie decisions for both routine and emergency vaccination, indicating a need for within community messaging and documentation of the household and population level benefits of FMD vaccination."],

        "Results: The mechanisms of oxidative stress defense in C. jejuni were characterized by transcriptional profiling and phenotypic analysis of wild-type and mutant strains. To define the regulon of the peroxide-sensing regulator, PerR, we constructed an isogenic [delta]perR mutant and compared its transcriptome profile with that of the wild-type strain. Transcriptome profiling identified 104 genes that belonged to the PerR regulon. PerR appears to regulate gene expression in a manner that both depends on and is independent of the presence of iron and/or H2O2. Mutation of perR significantly reduced motility. A phenotypic analysis using the chick colonization model showed that the [delta]perR mutant exhibited attenuated colonization behavior. An analysis of changes in the transcriptome induced by exposure to H2O2, cumene hydroperoxide, or menadione revealed differential expression of genes belonging to a variety of biological pathways, including classical oxidative stress defense systems, heat shock response, DNA repair and metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis, and multidrug efflux pumps. Mutagenic and phenotypic studies of the superoxide dismutase SodB, the alkyl-hydroxyperoxidase AhpC, and the catalase KatA, revealed a role for these proteins in oxidative stress defense and chick gut colonization.",

      abstract: ["The risk to human health of the annual sandhill crane (Grus canadensis) migration through Nebraska, which is thought to be a major source of fecal pollution of the central Platte River, is unknown. To better understand potential risks, the presence of Campylobacter species and three fecal indicator bacterial groups (Enterococcus spp., Escherichia coli, and Bacteroidetes) was assayed by PCR from crane excreta and water samples collected during their stopover at the Platte River, Nebraska, in 2010. Genus-specific PCR assays and sequence analyses identified Campylobacter jejuni as the predominant Campylobacter species in sandhill crane excreta. Campylobacter spp. were detected in 48% of crane excreta, 24% of water samples, and 11% of sediment samples. The estimated densities of Enterococcus spp. were highest in excreta samples (mean, 4.6 x 10^8 cell equivalents [CE]/g), while water samples contained higher levels of Bacteroidetes (mean, 5.1 x 10^5 CE/100 ml). Enterococcus spp., E. coli, and Campylobacter spp. were significantly increased in river water and sediments during the crane migration period, with Enterococcus sp. densities (~3.3 x 10^5 CE/g) 2 to 4 orders of magnitude higher than those of Bacteroidetes (4.9 x 10^3 CE/g), E. coli (2.2 x 10^3 CE/g), and Campylobacter spp. (37 CE/g). Sequencing data for the 16S rRNA gene and Campylobacter species-specific PCR assays indicated that C. jejuni was the major Campylobacter species present in water, sediments, and crane excreta. Overall, migration appeared to result in a significant, but temporary, change in water quality in spring, when there may be a C. jejuni health hazard associated with water and crops visited by the migrating birds."],

The primary objective of this report is to illustrate and determine the average physical dimensions of Gnathamitermes tubiformans soldiers by measuring key body parts, including left mandible length, as well as discuss observed foraging behavior. G.Tubiformans soldiers have unique mandibles that can be used for accurate identification. Workers are morphologically similar compared with some other arid-land termite species, thus soldier characteristics are used for identification. The secondary objective is to describe observations of G.Tubiformans foraging behavior. This report also provides detailed line drawings and a watercolor illustration for aid in identification. Termites were collected near Temple, Cotton County, Oklahoma, and measured with high precision microscopy. To ensure accurate identification, fourteen different soldier body measurements were determined. The ability to identify termites that are potentially beneficial or detrimental to forage grass biomass production may aid efforts to enhance livestock production on pastures."],

This phytotoxic aphid causes severe systemic damage symptoms in wheat, barley, and other small grains as a direct result of the salivary proteins it injects into the plant while feeding.",
        "Results: We sequenced and de novo assembled the genome of D. noxia Biotype 2, the strain most virulent to resistance genes in wheat. The assembled genomic scaffolds span 393 MB, equivalent to 93% of its 421 MB genome, and contains 19,097 genes. D. noxia has the most AT-rich insect genome sequenced to date (70.9%), with a bimodal CpG(O/E) distribution and a complete set of methylation related genes. The D. noxia genome displays a widespread, extensive reduction in the number of genes per ortholog group, including defensive, detoxification, chemosensory, and sugar transporter groups in comparison to the Acyrthosiphon pisum genome, including a 65% reduction in chemoreceptor genes. Thirty of 34 known D. noxia salivary genes were found in this assembly. These genes exhibited less homology with those salivary genes commonly expressed in insect saliva, such as glucose dehydrogenase and trehalase, yet greater conservation among genes that are expressed in D. noxia saliva but not detected in the saliva of other insects. Genes involved in insecticide activity and endosymbiont-derived genes were also found, as well as genes involved in virus transmission, although D. noxia is not a viral vector.",
        "Conclusions: This genome is the second sequenced aphid genome, and the first of a phytotoxic insect. D. noxia's reduced gene content of may reflect the influence of phytotoxic feeding in shaping the D. noxia genome, and in turn in broadening its host range. The presence of methylation-related genes, including cytosine methylation, is consistent with other parthenogenetic and polyphenic insects. The D. noxia genome will provide an important contrast to the A. pisum genome and advance functional and comparative genomics of insects and other organisms."],

The cellular sRNAs are processed by RNase III family enzyme dicer (Dicer like in plant) from a self-complementary hairpin loop or other type of RNA duplexes. The papaya genome has been sequenced, but its microRNAs and other regulatory RNAs are yet to be analyzed.",
        "Results: We analyzed the genomic features of the papaya sRNA population from three sRNA deep sequencing libraries made from leaves, flowers, and leaves infected with Papaya Ringspot Virus (PRSV). We also used the deep sequencing data to annotate the micro RNA (miRNA) in papaya. We identified 60 miRNAs, 24 of which were conserved in other species, and 36 of which were novel miRNAs specific to papaya. In contrast to the Chargaff's purine-pyrimidine equilibrium, cellular sRNA was significantly biased towards a purine rich population. Of the two purine bases, higher frequency of adenine was present in 23nt or longer sRNAs, while 22nt or shorter sRNAs were over represented by guanine bases. However, this bias was not observed in the annotated miRNAs in plants. The 21nt species were expressed from fewer loci but expressed at higher levels relative to the 24nt species. The highly expressed 21nt species were clustered in a few isolated locations of the genome. The PRSV infected leaves showed higher accumulation of 21 and 22nt sRNA compared to uninfected leaves. We observed higher accumulation of miRNA* of seven annotated miRNAs in virus-infected tissue, indicating the potential function of miRNA* under stressed conditions.",
        "Conclusions: We have identified 60 miRNAs in papaya. Our study revealed the asymmetric purine-pyrimidine distribution in cellular sRNA population. The 21nt species of sRNAs have higher expression levels than 24nt sRNA. The miRNA* of some miRNAs shows higher accumulation in PRSV infected tissues, suggesting that these strands are not totally functionally redundant.

DNA hybridization studies previously indicated that the coronatine biosynthetic gene cluster is highly conserved among P. syringae strains which produce the toxin. In the present study, two 17-bp oligonucleotide primers derived from the coronatine biosynthetic gene cluster of P. syringae pv. glycinea PG4180 were investigated for their ability to detect coronatine-producing P. syringae strains by PCR analysis. The primer set amplified diagnostic 0.65-kb PCR products from genomic DNAs of five different coronatine-producing pathovars of P. syringae. The 0.65-kb products were not detected when PCR experiments utilized nucleic acids of nonproducers of coronatine or those of bacteria not previously investigated for coronatine production. When the 0.65-kb PCR products were digested with ClaI, PstI, and SmaI, fragments of identical size were obtained for the five different pathovars of P. syringae. A restriction fragment length polymorphism was detected in the amplified region of P. syringae pv. atropurpurea, since this pathovar lacked a conserved PvuI site which was detected in the PCR products of the other four pathovars. The 0.65-kb PCR products from six strains comprising five different pathovars of P. syringae were cloned and sequenced. The PCR products from two different P. syringae pv. glycinea strains contained identical DNA sequences, and these showed relatedness to the sequence obtained for the pathovar morsprunorum. The PCR products obtained from the pathovars maculicola and tomato were the most similar to each other, which supports the hypothesis that these two pathovars are closely related. In conclusion, the region amplified by PCR was highly effective for the detection of coronatine-producing P. syringae strains, and the sequence analysis of PCR products proved valuable in showing relatedness between strains and pathovars."],

Seminole is a member of the genus Arhodomonas in the class Gammaproteobacteria, sharing 96% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with Arhodomonas aquaeolei HA-1. Analysis of the genome predicted a number of catabolic genes for the metabolism of benzene, toluene, 4-HBA, and PAA. The predicted pathways were corroborated by identification of enzymes present in the cytosolic proteomes of cells grown on aromatic compounds using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Genome analysis predicted a cluster of 19 genes necessary for the breakdown of benzene or toluene to acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) and pyruvate. Of these, 12 enzymes were identified in the proteome of toluene-grown cells compared to lactate-grown cells. Genomic analysis predicted 11 genes required for 4-HBA degradation to form the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates. Of these, proteomic analysis of 4-HBA-grown cells identified 6 key enzymes involved in the 4-HBA degradation pathway. Similarly, 15 genes needed for the degradation of PAA to the TCA cycle intermediates were predicted. Of these, 9 enzymes of the PAA degradation pathway were identified only in PAA-grown cells and not in lactate-grown cells. Overall, we were able to reconstruct catabolic steps for the breakdown of a variety of aromatic compounds in an extreme halophile, strain Seminole.

Currently approved treatments against influenza are losing effectiveness, as new viral strains are often refractory to conventional treatments. Thus, there is an urgent need to find new therapeutic targets with which to develop novel antiviral drugs. The common strategy to discover new drug targets and antivirals is high throughput screening. However, most current screenings for IAV rely on the engineered virus carrying a reporter, which prevents the application to newly emerging wild type flu viruses, such as 2009 pandemic H1N1 flu. Here we developed a simple and sensitive screening assay for wild type IAV by quantitatively analyzing viral protein levels using a Dot Blot Assay in combination with the LI-COR Imaging System (DBALIS). We first validated DBALIS in overexpression and RNAi assays, which are suitable methods for screening host factors regulating viral infection. More importantly, we also validated and initiated drug screening using DBALIS. A pilot compound screening identified a small molecule that inhibited IAV infection. Taken together, our method represents a reliable and convenient high throughput assay for screening novel host factors and antiviral compounds."],

His research involves characterizing the driving forces for molecular transfer, association, and solvation. Uncovering the whys behind the collective behavior of molecules in complex systems provides critical knowledge and power for rational design of targeted therapeutics, materials with specific physical properties, and self-organizing and assembling systems.\r\n\r\nTackling problems in complex molecular systems requires extensive sampling of system states. Fortunately, molecular mechanics simulations lend themselves quite well to parallel computing environments. As part of Dr. Fennell coming to OSU, he purchased a subsystem of compute nodes that were recently integrated into the Cowboy Cluster.\r\nIn addition to 24 CPU cores, these nodes each contain four Intel Xeon Phi cards. Each Phi card contains 228 simultaneous multithreading pipelines, and this hardware provides new capabilities that are not available on standard Cowboy compute nodes. When used fully, these Phi nodes can give upwards of a 1000-fold improvement in performance over a single core calculation.\r\n\r\nOSU HPCC supports researchers that want to take advantage of this newly available compute hardware."],

His basic research focuses on the development of theory and algorithms to solve combinatorial optimization problems that are motivated by graph-based data mining, social network analysis, computational biology, and other fields.\r\n\r\nThe problems he studies range from seeking specific patterns or substructures in networks to designing networks to have optimal structural properties like robustness and reachability. Even when the structural properties or patterns are simple to describe, the resulting optimization problems are often computationally intractable requiring an intelligent use of decomposition techniques in algorithm design, and the power of high performance parallel computing to solve.\r\n\r\nDr. Balasundaram and several other faculty from IEM that work broadly in the field of Operations Research, with help from OSU HPCC acquired cluster “Cimarron.” This large- memory cluster consists 10 compute nodes with dual quad core Intel E5620 processors, 6 of which have 96 GB RAM and 4 have 144 GB RAM. The cluster also hosts high-performance optimization packages like CPLEX and Gurobi. Since his research often employs worst-case exponential algorithms, such high-memory nodes and parallel computing are particularly advantageous to his group’s research, enabling optimal resolution on massive power-law networks with several million nodes that were previously unsolved."],

I wrote 24 pages, based on the average MFA requirements, but it will be the beginning of a full length creative nonfiction memoir. Each of these pieces started as a draft made for a creative nonfiction class, where it went through a workshop and then through a round of revisions. For my thesis, I took each of these pieces and revised them twice before getting feedback from my thesis director. After that, I took my thesis director's advice to make a final draft. I wanted to write this piece because families and people are always changing, but it is rare to think about how these changes affect individual people. It was important to me to capture these changes, especially the changes that come about because of divorce and the loss of a loved one, because these are characteristics that define my life in ways that my family couldn't have realized at the time.

      abstract: ["Osteopathic Medicine was founded by Dr. Andrew Taylor Still in the late 1800s (8). The basis of the founding of Osteopathic Medicine was to find a way to better the available medical practices which were unadvanced and crude during this time period (8). Osteopathic Manipulative Therapy (OMT) came about by the correlation between disease and a musculoskeletal abnormality that was discovered by Dr. A.T. Still (8). From this discovery, a disease treatment method that utilized pressure techniques and the musculoskeletal system was created and is now known as OMT Osteopathic Manipulative Therapy (8).",
        "Two widely utilized forms of pain management are over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription pain medications (1,6). OTC medications work by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins (3). Prescription opioid medications initiate their activity by binding to an opiate receptor (6). Opioid medications have many downfalls when considering chronic pain management (6), which include poor effectiveness rates, addiction and misuse (15).",
        "In comparison to other ethnic groups in the United States, Native American communities have higher drug overdose and mortality rates associated with overdose (16). One report indicated study that up to 30 % of the population in one reservation used oxycontin for a non-medical use (17). Fifty-nine percent of the individuals using oxycontin in this reservation who were not prescribed this drug by a physician claimed they took it for pain relief (17).",
        "The purpose of this review is to identify the potential effectiveness of Osteopathic Manipulative Therapy as a chronic pain management technique. To do so, the PubMed database was searched for articles related to the terms, osteopathic manipulative therapy, OMT, pain, and chronic pain. This review is based on the articles found from this search.",
        "The articles presented in this thesis provide evidence that of OMT reduced or relieved pain associated with chronic low back and pain, in pregnant and postpartum women and in patients with: cancer; cystic fibrosis; chronic migraine; spinal cord injuries; shoulder problems; and traumatic knee arthritis. Additional research work pertaining to the effects of OMT on multiple sclerosis management, wound healing, diaphragm motion, pulmonary function, and cerebral perfusion, are also included in this thesis.",
        "The impact of OMT being utilized as a pain management technique is not completely understood. However, if OMT could be utilized for pain management, then opioids use could be curtailed. A reduction in opioid use could help reduce the complications with these drugs such as dependence, addiction, and drug tolerance. In addition, clinics and medical centers could then be established for the purpose of using OMT for pain alleviation.",
        "Currently, some Native American tribes are promoting the use of OMT through their tribal nation’s healthcare system. For instance, the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma offers OMT services at two locations (26). If further in depth research supported OMT for pain relief, clinics offering OMT could be established in all Native American tribal nations and reservations and be promoted as a pain management resource. If this occurred, then OMT could be used to combat the opioid and prescription drug problems in the American Indian populations."],

      abstract: ["Introduction: Due to the growing popularity of sports climbing and other grip strength dependent sports, there has been increasing interest in determining the best method for intermittent recovery during extended climbing bouts to help combat forearm and finger flexor fatigue. The two main methods utilized by climbers to do so are 'shaking out' and passive stretching via wrist and finger extension. Presumably, these techniques are utilized to reduce the occluded arterial inflow brought upon by intramuscular pressure, which reduces oxygenation of the active muscles.",
        "Methods: Forty-five college-age males and females participated in this IRB approved study and were randomly assigned to three groups: 'shaking out', stretching, and resting (control) with the arms at the side. Prior to assessing maximal hang time, each participant's grip strength was measured. Subsequently, each participant was asked to hang by the proximal interphalangeal joints of digits 2-5 for maximal time. Following the maximal hang time, the participants performed one of the three protocols for 30s and grip strength was again assessed, and a second maximal hang time was recorded. Data collected during the study was compared using repeating measures ANOVA with an alpha level set at p<0.05.",
        "Results: There were no significant differences among pre- grip strength results between the groups and no significant (p>0.05) differences from pre- to post grip strength assessments for any of the conditions (Table 1). However, the shake and stretch conditions recorded slightly larger post-test grip deficits (-13.3% and -13.1% respectively) than the rest condition (-8.1%). For maximal hang time no pre-hang significant (p>0.05) differences were found among the conditions. However, each condition registered significant (p<0.05) pre- to post-test changes (Table 2) but no significant differences were found between the conditions.",
        "Conclusion: While the rest condition resulted in slightly less grip strength fatigue following maximal hang time, post-hang time was not affected by any of the conditions presented in this research. These results suggest that none of the protocols used in the current study is superior in reducing occlusion and restoring of muscle oxygenation."],

This qualitative study investigated sociocultural factors affecting sun exposure for infants of women from three categories: initial pregnancies, mothers of infants 1-2 y, and grandmothers.",
        "Methods: Eighteen focus groups with ~10 participants each were held in three urban and three rural communities. In-depth interviews were conducted with local health extension workers (HEWs).",
        "Results: Reports from grandmothers indicated that awareness of benefits of sun exposure for infants has increased in the last generation. Practicing infant sun exposure is a generally accepted practice among all participants. Mothers wait to expose their infants to sunlight for 1-3 months in rural and ~15 days in urban areas. The prevalent feeling was that roughly 30 minutes of morning sunlight (7-9 am), never afternoon sun, was best for infant health. Barriers mentioned for mothers were headaches, skin irritation, catching a cold from drafts, and general discomfort. Barriers for infant exposure postpartum included fear of the evil eye and catching a cold from drafts. Only 2/82 rural and 26/88 urban women freely associated sunlight with vitamin D. HEWs provided health information for a self-reported 96% of rural and 88% of urban women. Most participants agreed that sun exposure was generally healthy for their infants with urban women citing more knowledge of its benefits for bone health than rural women.",
        "Discussion: It appears that, besides heavy sunlight, mothers have few aversions to sunlight itself. Rather, they fear illness caused by public exposure (evil eye) and temperature changes (drafts causing colds). Delays in initiating sun exposure and short exposure duration in the mornings only may prevent adequate vitamin D synthesis in this population. Variable understanding of the specific importance of sun exposure amongst rural women and of sources of vitamin D in both groups indicates disparities in knowledge transfer and application. Our data support additional training of both rural and urban HEWs regarding benefits of sun exposure for infants in order to increase this behavior, promote its earlier initiation, and increase its duration in both rural and urban populations."],

It is important that health care providers have an appropriate understanding of the perceptions of mental health resources for college athletes, because they are less likely to report mental health issues, (De Souza et al. 2019).  The purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of student athletes' knowledge and use of mental health resources, as well as perceptions of stigma about accessing resources. This study focuses on three National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I teams, and the athletes' personal experiences with mental healthcare. Each athlete completed a survey that centered around their physical health, mental health, and their experience with accessing mental health resources. Results suggest that student athletes experience added stress due to their status as student athletes, and believe that mental health resources offered through the university's athletic department would be beneficial.

Over the past several years colloidal quantum dots have been garnering more attention with their rise in photovoltaic device performance and power efficiency, from 3.5% in 2010 to 16.6% in 2019. Many of the attempts to improve photovoltaics’ overall device efficiency have been focused on device architecture and materials improvement. Doping chalcogenide-based quantum dots with transition metals like Mn or Co has been shown to dramatically improve device efficiency and overall light absorption, respectively. In this research project, Mo-Mo-dimers (Mod) are doped into ZnS quantum dots using a wet chemical method. The quantum dot’s optical properties, crystallinity, and size are explored using optical absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy. Then the quantum dots are incorporated, via successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction, into a solar cell architecture to form a p-n junction with a hybrid halide perovskite film. The hybrid halide films in this project consist of CH3NH3PbI3 due to their reported high efficiencies in photovoltaic cells. The overall goal is to observe and interpret changes in the open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current of a working photovoltaic cell in order to determine if Mod doping has any efficacy when combined with hybrid halide perovskite films."],

      abstract: ["Movies and film make up a large component of our cultural landscape, but what those films say about our personalities is relatively under-studied. With this research, I set out to discover any connections between our film and movie preferences and our personalities, using the Big Five Factor model of personality as a guideline. Another important factor in my analysis was the interaction of gender. Participants were asked to indicate the degree to which they enjoyed various film genres, and then were given a brief Big Five Factor personality test. Notable correlations were found between the personality factor of extraversion and the genres of comedy and romance, and between the factor of openness to experience and the genres of documentary and science fiction. Significant gender differences were also observed, with women rating the genres of drama and romance higher than men, and men rating action and science fiction higher than women. These differences likely explain some of the correlations between traits and film preference in this study, as the sample was predominantly female. The findings of this study help lay the groundwork for a comprehensive, media-based model of personality, but further research is needed to develop the model to its full extent."],

      abstract: ["Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) is characterized by excessive fear of social situations that can result in avoidance in these situations. Additionally, individuals with SAD will show information processing biases when interpreting social information. One way to study these information processing biases is with event related potentials (ERP). Studies have shown that individuals with SAD will show early attentional vigilance to facial cues by increasing attentional resources when viewing angry faces. Additionally, some studies have shown that attentional biases extend to later processing, as well. Individuals with SAD will show increased processing of all faces, regardless of emotional state. This study uses the Late Positive Potential (LPP) to evaluate potential attentional biases held by individuals with SAD when creating neutral and negative self-images. Sixty-eight participants were recruited and separated into high and low social anxiety groups. Participants were instructed that they would be given a speech. Then participants were randomized to conditions that either attempted to increase anticipation anxiety or not. Following this, participants listened to audio recordings that were either neutral (e.g. sitting in a classroom) or threatening (e.g. being embarrassed publicly) and were asked to imagine themselves in the described scenario. Contrary to previous research, we found that the LPP was elicited for both the neutral and threatening scenarios. Additionally, we found no group differences between the low socially anxious group and the high socially anxious group. Finally, anticipation of a speech had no influence on the elicitation of the LPP. These results suggest that the effects of negative self-imagery may have similar effects on individuals with high and low social anxiety. Additionally, they also suggest that the audio recordings used in this study may not have been effective, as suggested by the similar LPP between neutral and threatening scenarios."],

The syndecan family is composed of various proteoglycans that each aid in cell-to-cell communication, and cell signaling pathways. Syndecan-1 plays a role in the initiation and progression of many different types of cancer. The overall goal of our research is to express and isolate the human syndecan-1 protein in bacterial cells, and then proceed with glycosylation of the protein. In order to have effective expression and cleavage of syndecan-1, a His6-Trp?LE fusion partner was attached to the syndecan-1 protein, and the sequence of syndecan-1 was altered to replace any cysteine and methionine residues with serine residues. The path to achieving this involves a growth of cells with emphasis on the expression of syndecan-1, a chemical cleavage of the Trp[Delta]LE fusion partner from the syndecan-1 protein, purification by size-exclusion chromatography, and each step monitored by SDS-PAGE to show expression and purity. The syndecan-1 protein in its altered form weighs 31.903kDa, and the Trp[Delta]LE weighs approximately 14kDa. We found that we were successful in cleavage and expression via SDS-PAGE, and got separation of protein through size-exclusion chromatography, but have not expressed a large amount of protein from growths, nor have we gotten proof of our protein expression by mass spectrometry. In the future, we plan on making slight adjustments in protocol and doing more growths to create more protein to work with, and find a reason that we are unable to identify the protein by mass spectrometry."],

After identifying the areas of potential improvement, the report provides analysis and recommendations for the following areas: checkout line, sale floor organization, volunteer roles, setup processes, opportunities for additional revenue, and the accounting system.",
        "The team was introduced to the current situation through discussion with Wee-Cycle Bartlesville owner, Sara Freeman, and observation of the August 2016 sale. Sara identified her biggest concern to be the length of the checkout line during peak shopping hours of the sale. Additionally, she expressed interest in upgrading her current display equipment to accommodate more items. Volunteer roles, setup processes and an accounting system were other areas with potential improvement.",
        "In order to collect data related to the checkout line, the team observed peak shopping hours during the August 2016 sale. During the observations, the team identified a lack of consistency in the checkout processes of the various cashiers. Some cashiers completed transactions much faster than others, resulting in the team's recommendation to establish and use a standardized cashier process based on that of the fastest cashier. In addition, a volunteer helping bag items is recommended to decrease transaction time.",
        "To address Sara's interest in upgrading her sale floor equipment, the team observed the current clothing racks, tables and other display equipment used at the August 2016 sale. Her current clothing racks are a combination of saddle racks and Creform racks, with Creform racks having the ability to hold twice as many clothing items per linear foot. After weighing the cost to convert the remaining racks from saddle to Creform, the team recommends replacing all saddle racks with Creform racks. Along with the clothing racks, Wee-Cycle Bartlesville also displays items on standard 8-foot tables. The team also identified potential gain in display space if a simple shelf was placed on top of the display tables to allow for the display of additional items.",
        "Sara is often the first resource volunteers and customers seek out when a problem or question arises. She expressed great interest in being able to manage her sale, rather than spread herself thin working a register, briefing volunteers, and answering customer questions. To address this concern, the team focused on improving the volunteer roles. Roles currently lack definition and volunteers lack training, which limits the volunteer's understanding of their responsibilities. The team developed and documented volunteer role definitions and a brief training guide, the use of which are recommended to reduce confusion and questions to Sara.",
        "Another potential area investigated for improvement was the setup process. At this time, consignors drop off their items on either Tuesday or Wednesday based on the first letter of their last name anytime between 12:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. Because consignors decide when to drop off their items, Sara and her staff experience idle time due to the variation in consignors' arrival times. To limit the employee idle time, the team recommends assigning consignor drop-off times. This change will allow Wee-Cycle Bartlesville to better anticipate how much time is needed for setup, and potentially open the sale a day early.",
        "Finally, Wee-Cycle Bartlesville does not have a formal accounting system. To address this, the team created an Excel-based accounting system which allows Sara to quickly enter and easily see her expenses and revenues. The accounting system can help capture expenses and identify cost trends and potential revenues in future Wee-Cycle Bartlesville operations.",
        "Implementing these changes requires a $3,068.12 investment and implementing the changes will provide an estimated $12,066.19 in additional revenue at the next sale for Wee-Cycle Bartlesville."],

      abstract: ["Black bears (Ursus americanus) are omnivorous and therefore consume a wide variety of foods. Food availability, however, changes by season and an understanding of what is consumed during the different seasons can provide useful information for management. Although black bears are capable of catching small mammals and newborn ungulates, the majority of their diet in the southeastern U.S. is made up of vegetation and insects. Climate has a large impact on what foods are available for bears to eat, which is why it is important for us to understand their habits and diet as populations move and grow into the warmer, more southern states. Because black bears were extirpated from Oklahoma in the early 1900's, knowledge of their current diet will help manage the new population and mitigate human-wildlife conflict. The goal of this study was to identify food types in scat samples in a recolonizing population of black bears in southeastern Oklahoma and to make a comparison of black bear diets across seasons. The study population is located in the Ouachita National Forest (ONF) and surrounding areas and focuses on the change in their diet throughout the seasons. Oklahoma in particular is a mix of prairie and woodland, with fragments of each intermingling. Vegetation (including leaves, stems, flowers, and seeds) is the predominant food type consumed by black bears in this study. Berries in particular make up a large proportion of the bears' diets. While Oklahoma black bears also consumed a large amount of insects, they seem not to be as common in the diet as has been seen in more northern studies. The frequency of occurrence of mammals in southeastern Oklahoma black bear diets appeared small, at only 0.144. Although they do consume acorns, these do not make up a significant portion of their diet, even during the denning season. Corn is more common in samples from the Ozarks than the southeastern sites, and there is a noticeable increase in corn consumption during the late summer compared to early summer and the denning season. This pattern could lead to a potential increase in human-bear conflicts in the northeastern part of Oklahoma."],

      abstract: ["Printing methods are continually evolving bringing forth new possibilities and ranging purposes for placing ink on the page. What originally propelled the human race into efficiently putting the written language into printed word for mass production was the original printing press. However, older methods utilized this idea of multiplication and a mechanical component through methods such as lithography, woodblock, intaglio and monotype. As technology has rapidly developed and presented us with the possibilities of those in the twenty-first century, the printing press has been replaced by the highly sophisticated, computerized form, the modern-day digital printer. As both a graphic designer and fine art printmaker, this creative project was an exploration of both printing methods and how they can be combined to not only exist amongst each other, but more importantly compliment each other. It was also an exploration of the relationship between the printmaking practice of \"editions\" and how the value in this idea of multiples drastically differs from the digital printers form of multiples in \"copies.\" The process of this project worked in reverse historically, beginning with the most modern digital creating and printing methods. Utilizing the Adobe Software Creative Suite, images were first created using Photoshop brushes and Illustrator type tools on a Mac laptop computer. A total of eleven unique images were created. Four copies were digitally printed on a large-format Canon printer, but resulted in four slightly differing editions once they moved from a digital space to a fine art space. Throughout the refining process two images were removed from the final portfolio of images. A portfolio presentation box was also created with the thesis director at the conclusion of the making process. While the visuals of each image were different, their subject matter could either could be classified to depict aspects of the human figure or definitions and short statements regarding the human experience. While the subject matter of each image was carefully crafted, the purpose of this project did not root itself in understanding the iconography of each image, but more importantly the overall process in how each final image was created. After the digital printing process, the images were then transferred to the printmaking studio where the images were run through various presses utilizing the printmaking methods of polyester smart plate lithography and monotype. Every image was run through the press multiple times utilizing both of these methods to create an image that invites the viewer into an experience of seeing. The layered imagery, overlapping typography and multiple color incorporation created by both digital and traditional printing methods resulted in a set of images whose value came in not only the extensive layering, but how that layering was achieved."],

      abstract: ["Several studies have reported a gender bias in the prevalence of antisocial personality disorder (ASPD); however, determining the cause of such biases remains to be accomplished. The dominant explanation for gender bias is a bias within the diagnosis and diagnostic criteria of ASPD. Previous research has primarily focused on male populations when examining ASPD resulting in males being the standard of comparison, and thus not generalizable to female populations. In attempt to challenge this standard, researchers have examined ASPD in female populations and reported a difference in the prevalence of ASPD between the genders. Researchers have since further investigated this difference and reported it might be attributed to biases in the diagnostic criteria of ASPD. In addition to gender biases in ASPD, there are reported observed gender biases in psychopathy. The explanation for the differences in gender is that some PCL-R (psychopathy checklist revised) items are biased towards gender, which results in different prevalence rates between the genders. To contribute to the existing research, I completed a systematic literature review examining the observable gender patterns in ASPD, conduct disorder (CD), and psychopathy. The culmination of articles in the review revealed that there are significant differences in gender in ASPD, CD, and psychopathy diagnoses. Although, the explanation for the differences in ASPD diagnoses have yet to be identified."],

The objective of these studies was to evaluate the effects of different colors of shade nets on growth and flowering of pansies. In the first experiment, pansies ('Clear Yellow', 'Buttered Popcorn', and 'Deep Orange' were placed under 30% blue or black shade net, or a control with no shade net. In the second experiment, pansies of the same three cultivars were grown under 50% black, red, pearl, or Aluminet shade net. Data were collected on plant height, plant width, flower number, plant survival, SPAD readings, and light quality. In experiment one, the blue shade net reduced height to flower and height to leaves, but also decreased flower number and plant survival as compared to black shade net. All plants under no shade died. In experiment two, SPAD, an indicator of plant quality, was found to be lower under black shade net, while pearl shade net led to a decrease in plant height and no effect on number of flowers. Light quality, including R:FR ratio, varied among shade treatments, while light intensity was reduced under Aluminet, black (50%), and red shade nets compared to other shade treatments.

Thermometers are important in all medical fields, both human and veterinary alike. Accuracy and reliability of these tools are critical to determine the best treatment options for ill patients. A statistical analysis was run using SigmaPlot 12.5 to determine thermometer reliability while simple mean calculations measured accuracy. In total thirty-two thermometers were tested in three water baths set at 35°C, 38°C, and 40°C. These temperatures represent a hypothermic state, normal animal body temperature and a hyperthermic state respectively. Each thermometer was tested seven times per temperature and compared to a true temperature measured by a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) thermometer. There is a strong correlation between accuracy and reliability and all thermometers that were the most accurate were found to be the most reliable. A used Walgreens brand thermometer model VT801SWT was the most reliable and accurate overall. Results also show that new thermometers are more accurate than used ones with a few exceptions. A Reli-On two-second thermometer lot 4414 was the most unreliable with widely skewed results. Significant differences were not detected between human and animal thermometers.

In order to accomplish this various marketing models were examined after the economic environment of the nation was analyzed with particular emphasis on the recent developments brought about by the energy crisis. The overall tone of the study was one of guarded optimism. The optimism was shown in the industry model where sales for the entire automobile industry were examined and small car sales were seen to be on the rise. The operation and expansion of the Toyo Kogyo Company of Japan was covered in the company model. The company started mass producing rotary engines in 1967 and marketed them to the Mazda automobile. Mazda's competitive position was examined the competitive model. In this model, Mazda's relation to the industry was analyzed and the entry of other automobile manufacturers into the rotary engine field was explored. The costs of inventory acquisition and storage were presented in the channel model. Then the market share model for Stillwater was given. The model viewed the demographic characteristics of the community as they affect advertising and market strategy of the Mazda dealer.",

Thirty-six scenarios were developed in which the. Primary variables altered were the type of debt used in the firm's capital structure (bonds with indexed interest only, bonds with indexed principal only, bonds with indexed interest and principal, traditional long-term bonds, and short-term debt), and the direction of change in the inflation rate (increasing decreasing, constant, or random). Income statements and balance sheets were generated for each scenario from which selected measures for three areas of financial performance were calculated: cash flow, profitability, and risk. Measures for the cash flow analysis included annual interest expense (indexed and non-indexed), principal repayment (with and without a sinking fund), and total cash flow (interest plus principal). A hypothetical price index was used to adjust indexed interest and/or principal. Measures for profitability analysis included return on investment, return on net-worth, and net profit margin. Measures for risk analysis included coverage ratios (times interest earned and fixed charge coverage), debt ratios (total debt~ total assets and total debt~ net worth), and statistical measures (mean, variance, and standard deviation of earnings per share).",
        "Findings and Conclusions: Traditional non-indexed bonds and those with only the, interest indexed were consistently found to be the most beneficial debt instruments for the firm to use during any inflation conditions. The firm would naturally prefer to use traditional, fixed-rate debt (except during decreasing inflation when indexed interest bonds would decrease cash flow and increase profitability), but during rapidly rising inflation this option is not always available as investors will not lend funds for a fixed-return for the long-term. When indexing is chosen as an alternative source of funds, then bonds with only the interest indexed provide the most beneficial impact on all areas of financial performance. Bonds which include an indexed principal feature were found to significantly increase the demand on the firm's cash, annually if a sinking fund is used and only at maturity if a sinking fund is not used. More default risk was added to the firm's capital structure using indexed principal bonds since the liability becomes larger each year during any inflation conditions as long as the inflation rate is greater than zero. Return on investment was the only area of profitability affected by these bonds. The exclusive use of short-term debt was found to be the least beneficial to the firm in all areas of performance under any inflation conditions. All findings and conclusions are subject to the constraints of the model."],

The primary purpose of the survey was to determine the market position of beef (steak, beef roast, and hamburger) relative to other meat products. The study was limited to the Stillwater, Oklahoma area and 43 surveys were used in the analysis. The results of the completed surveys were tabulated and the data analyzed using a computer program called MDPREF (Multi- dimensional Preference Scaling).",
        "Findings and Conclusions: The results of the analysis indicate that beef has both weaknesses and strengths in its market position. Beef is perceived as less healthy, heavier, and higher in calories and cholesterol relative to poultry and fish. Also, with the exception of hamburger, beef is perceived as having a high cost, an inconsistent quality, a high failure rate, a short shelf life, and a long preparation time. Beef's main strengths (especially for steak and beef roast) are its perceptions of great taste and high status. This author concluded that these negative perceptions of beef have been partially responsible for the decline in beef consumption over the last 15 years. Beef associations, wholesalers, and retailers around the country must alter the components of their marketing mix, and develop promotional programs to re-position beef in the consumer's mind."],

They are characterized by a variety of acid hydrolases capable of degrading proteins, nucleic acids, and mucopolysaccharides. These enzymes are retained within the particles, and prevented from acting on surrounding substrates, by a lipoprotein membrane impermeable to these substrates. The simultaneous release of all internal enzymes in soluble and fully active form follows injury to the membrane. Whether or not they are finally classed as organelles, they are functionally important in many tissues and may hold the key to certain pathological phenomena of cell activities, and thus, of whole organisms."],

Over time, pollen limitation may negatively impact wild flowering plant populations. Mass flowering crops (MFCs) such as canola (Brassica napus L.) increase foraging resource availability to wild bees in historically forage-poor agroecosystems. Increased foraging resources by way of MFCs may enhance or dilute pollination of wild flowering plants growing nearby. We tested the effects of canola cover on wild bee-plant mutualisms by evaluating seed count and weight of three wild flowering plants, Gaillardia pulchella (Foug.; Indian blanket), Verbesina encelioides (Cav.; cowpen daisy), and Salvia azurea (Michx ex Lam.; azure blue sage), across a gradient of canola cover. We also tested pollen limitation of each of the selected wild flowering plants. Each species increased seed set as canola cover increased at one or more spatial scales, suggesting canola may enhance pollination services to wild flowering plants. However, each species also demonstrated pollen limitation. MFCs may play an important role in supporting wild bees and wild flowering plants in some agroecosystems by providing foraging resources for bees and by enhancing pollination services to wild flowering plants. Our results show that MFCs may facilitate wild bee pollination of some wild flowering plants. In the context of ongoing wild bee declines, understanding the effects of MFCs on wild bee-plant mutualisms is important in the conservation of wild bees and wild flowering plants."],

      abstract: ["Diverse communities of groundwater-dwelling organisms (i.e., stygobionts) are important for human wellbeing. However, we lack an understanding of the factors driving their distributions, making it difficult to protect these at-risk species. Obtaining distribution data for stygobionts is diffiult because subterranean environments are some of the most difficult to sample. New sampling methods, such as environmental DNA (eDNA), show promise to improve stygobiont detection, but sources of sampling bias are poorly understood. Our study objectives were to quatify detection probability using traditional visual surveys and eDNA surveys for both cavefishes and cave crayfishes and determine the landscape factors related to the occurrence of cavefishes and cave crayfishes in the Ozark Highlands ecoregion, USA. We sampled cavefishes and cave crayfishes at 61 sampling units using both visual and environmental DNA surveys. We then modeled occurrence probability in relation to lithology and human disturbance while accounting for imperfect detection. The effectiveness of eDNA or visual surveys varied by environmental conditions (i.e., water volume, prevailing substrate, and water velocity) and the target taxa. Our results also indicated that occurrence probability of cave crayfishes was negatively associated with human disturbance, whereas there was a weak positive relationship between cavefish occurrence and disturbance. Both cavefishes and cave crayfishes were more likely to occur in limestone rather than dolostone lithology. Individual cave crayfish species were restricted to dolostone or limestone lithology; however, the Ozark cavefish (Troglichthys rosae) was detected in both lithology types. Our results indicate structuring factors are related to the distribution of these taxa, but with human disturbance as a prevalent modifier of distributions for crayfish taxa. Limiting human alteration near karst features may be warranted to promote the persistence of some stygobionts. Moreover, our results suggest current sampling efforts are inadequate to detect cryptic species; therefore, expanding sampling may be needed to develop effective conservation actions."],

      abstract: ["Stream fish distributions are hypothesized to be strongly associated with landscape characteristics at multiple scales. Variation in flow regimes and intensity of landscape disturbance is associated with stream fish distributions; however, relationships are poorly understood in many high-diversity regions. Our objective was to identify occurrence relationships between fish distributions and streamflow and landscape characteristics in the south-central United States. Our study area was the central Red River catchment in Oklahoma, Texas, and Arkansas, USA. We used existing fish surveys to model the occurrence of a diverse, warmwater assemblage among hydraulic response units (HRUs). We used multispecies occupancy modeling to identify variation in occurrence probability among 111 stream fishes in relation to landscape disturbance and flow regime characteristics. We found significant occurrence relationships with landscape disturbance and 11 metrics comprising all flow regime components. The relationships varied within both major species groups and some genera. Frequency and duration were the most common flow regime relationships. More common stream fishes tended to be positively associated with higher levels of landscape disturbance and flow regime metrics representing variability. Conversely, less-tolerant, narrow-ranged fishes tended to be negatively associated. Occurrence relationships with flow metrics representing high-flow events were predominately negative. As expected, many species were strongly associated with and ecoregion with landscape disturbance and flow relationships held constant. Our study informs land-use and water management decisions and stream fish conservation at multiple spatial scales. Collectively, the findings suggest potential homogenization of the Red River fish assemblage with increased landscape disturbance and streamflow variability. A reduction in landscape disturbance and maintenance of natural flow patterns at coarser scales may benefit endemic and narrow-ranged fishes. Our findings also guide finer-scale land-use and water management decisions by identifying stream network areas with a high occurrence probability of less-tolerant fishes."],

Named after the town near the seismic acquisition site, the section is referred to as red beds of Hazlehurst (RbH) in this paper. The stratigraphic section can be mainly identified structurally and stratigraphically in reflection seismic profiles. It sits unconformably above the syn-rift Triassic basin strata or basement rocks and sits below the regional basal unconformity (\"J\") of the Coastal Plain sequence. Due to the similar lithologies with the exposed Triassic basin red beds and sparse well penetrations, RbH has yet to be clearly documented. As a result, the areal extent of the underlying Triassic rift basins in the southeastern U.S. was overestimated. This contribution implies that the RbH 1) pinches out stratigraphically up dip of the Fall Line and thins down dip of the coastline, 2) could have a regional areal extent over 300,000 km2 along the north American margin before erosion, 3) is largely composed of undeformed sub-horizontal sedimentary red beds, and 4) provides age constraints for the rift-to-drift transition and a two-phased magmatism tectonic evolution model."],

      abstract: ["The 6300 m2 two-story Studenthuset building at Stockholm University in Stockholm, completed in 2013, was thoroughly instrumented.  Space heating and hot water are provided by a ground source heat pump (GSHP) system consisting of five 40 kW off-the-shelf water-to-water heat pumps connected to 20 boreholes of 200 m depth in hard rock. Space cooling is provided by direct cooling from the boreholes. This system has now been monitored for five years. This paper presents the results in the form of a range of performance indicators that describe the short-term and long-term system performance. Performance factors are computed for several boundaries defined by the IEA HPT Annex 52 boundary schema. Seasonal, monthly, daily, and binned performance factors for both heating and cooling operation are presented and discussed. Contrary to expectations based on thermodynamic theory, the performance is better correlated to the quantity of heating or cooling provided than it is to the exiting fluid temperatures from the ground heat exchanger. Despite being in Stockholm, the building rejects about 30% more than it extracts, leading to a minimal temperature increase over the five measured years. The analysis indicates that if operated as is, the GHE will not exceed its temperature constraints for many decades. The five-year seasonal performance factor (SPF) for combined heating and cooling is 5.2±0.2 considering only the heat pump and source-side circulating pump. However, the load-side distribution system and Legionella protection systems result in a significant decrease in the 5-year combined heating and cooling SPF at the outer boundary to 1.8±0.3."],

      abstract: ["Catostomidae (catostomids) are suckers of the order Cyprinifores and the majority of species are native to North America; however, species in this group are understudied and rarely managed. The popularity in bowfishing and gigging for suckers in the United States has increased concerns related to overfishing. Little information exists about the relative gear effectiveness for sampling catostomids. Our study objective was to evaluate the relative effectiveness of boat electrofishing for sampling Black Redhorse Moxostoma duquesnei, Golden Redhorse M. erythrurum, Northern Hogsucker Hypentelium nigricans, White Sucker, and Spotted Sucker populations in Lake Eucha, OK. We used an information theoretic approach to determine the abiotic variables related to sucker catch per effort (C/f). Our analysis indicated that sucker C/f was highest during night and decreased with increasing water temperature. Sucker size structure was significantly different between daytime and nighttime samples; however, effect size estimates for size structure comparisons indicated size distributions exhibited moderate overlap. Distributional comparisons indicated daytime and nighttime samples were similar for fish >180 mm total length (TL). Effect size estimates also suggested little association between the proportion of each species captured and time of day or water temperature. Night electrofishing at water temperatures from 16-25 ⁰C yielded the most precise C/f estimates. If managers are interested in precision, then we recommend night electrofishing suckers in reservoirs at water temperatures from 16-25 ⁰C; though, if total number of suckers is more important than precision, samples taken at night from 6-15 ⁰C are recommended. Further study of the relationship between abiotic variables and catostomid catchability using various gears would be beneficial to agencies interested in these populations."],

The natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) generation facility rests upon a thick succession of Mesozoic strata that contains numerous saline reservoirs that hold significant potential for carbon sequestration. To further characterize these reservoirs and evaluate their storage capacity, an integrated approach was used combining data from cores and geophysical well logs.",
        "Mesozoic strata thicken to the southwest and unconformably overlie Paleozoic strata in Kemper County. Cretaceous units, such as the Paluxy Formation, Washita-Fredericksburg interval, and the lower Tuscaloosa Group are lithologically similar in that they are composed of sandstone and conglomerate that fine upward into interbedded sandstone and mudrock. Furthermore, the sandstone units contain saline water (>10,000 mg/L TDS), have high porosity (~30%), and have Darcy-class permeability making them particularly attractive for geologic storage.",
        "To better understand sediment provenance and reservoir quality, petrologic analysis was used to determine framework grain composition, which was then plotted on Dickinson provenance diagrams. Furthermore, petrologic analysis was used to document diagenetic alterations and the resulting sedimentary fabrics influencing porosity. Lastly, geophysical well logs were used to identify reservoir quality packages using gamma ray and porosity cutoffs of ≤ 75 API units and ≥ 15%, respectively. The resulting net reservoir sandstone thickness and average porosity values for selected reservoirs was mapped and used to calculate CO2 storage capacity.",
        "Results from routine core analysis suggest that Cretaceous sandstone was deposited as channel and bar deposits in bedload-dominated fluvial systems. Subsequent bifurcation of channels left deposits stranded and subaerially exposed, thus allowing vegetation, burrowing, and feldspar dissolution to occur. Significant feldspar dissolution created an abundance of secondary porosity in the form of moldic and oversized pores and left behind only minor amounts of pore-filling kaolinite. Ultimately, this enhanced the original porosity and permeability of sandstone reservoirs resulting in a P50 storage resource of 428 Mt in the Paluxy Formation, 753 Mt in the Washita-Fredericksburg interval, and 182 Mt in the lower Tuscaloosa Group."],

Up until the introduction of the jet engine in 1939, and still today, aircraft used a fixed-pitch propeller based propulsion system.  Fixed-pitch propellers have low manufacturing costs and have a weight advantage over other propulsion types. However, when choosing the proper propeller for an aircraft, the designer must compromise between areas of performance, i.e. a propeller designed to optimize take-off performance may have poor performance in cruise, and vice versa. In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, have become increasingly popular, both in the amateur hobbyist world as well as in commercial and military applications. As with large-scale aircraft, UAVs suffer in performance largely due to the use of fixed pitch propellers. Large aircraft make use of constant speed propellers driven by oil-based hydraulic systems from the vehicles engine, which are not available for small UAVs. A system is designed, constructed and tested for Group 2 UAVs using the two primary performance points, take-off and cruise, as the basis for analysis. The system is governed by propeller RPM and allows for operator control based on throttle input."],

Twenty one members of a Division I women's soccer team completed body composition testing (DEXA), power and endurance performance testing (VO2max, Wingate testing, vertical jump), and 3-day food records. Average baseline body mass was 63.3 ? 6.4 kg. Fat mass and body fat percentage significantly decreased and lean body mass significantly increased from baseline to post-test. Performance measures of VO2max, mean wattage (Wingate testing), anaerobic capacity, and fatigue index significantly improved from baseline. Change in fat mass was shown to have a significant correlation to the changes in VO2max, fatigue index, and peak watts. Aside from percentage energy consumed from protein, no significant changes in energy or macronutrient intake were found. The players consumed energy levels below the minimal recommended energy levels (min. 30 kcal/kg) and carbohydrate levels (min. 5 g/kg).

Despite the previous research showing the contributions of goats to livestock and forage production systems in multi-species grazing pastures, the economic aspects of adding a meat goat enterprise to an existing beef operation have not been fully studied and quantified. This study seeks to determine the profitability of integrating beef and meat goat enterprises, given a specified amount of land and capital plus assumptions concerning available farm resources and productivity levels. Since a whole farm approach is needed to understand the optimal allocation of resources, a Linear Programming model is used. The study focuses on three farm sizes, small, medium and large for Southeast and Northeast Oklahoma. The scenarios for the study include native pasture, native pasture with forest, native and improved pasture with forest, and native and improved pasture with forest and cropland.Solutions for the base scenario with no livestock constraints include a mix of beef and goats. Results are similar for other land use scenarios (native pasture with forest land, native and improved pasture with forest land and native and improved pasture with forest and cropland) in that both beef and goats are included in the optimal solution. Dry matter availability from forage production together with the ability to purchase hay and supplements determines the stocking rate and the mix of livestock species. In the unrestricted solutions, breeding goats substitute for beef stockers, stocker goats are eliminated, and beef cow numbers increase on all farm sizes, which indicate that the beef cows and breeding goat enterprises are complementary. In every scenario and farm size, the inclusion of goats with beef enterprise results in an increase in net returns, lowers the capital required and improves forage and pasture utilization on the farm."],

The combination of anesthesia, exposure to a relatively cold operating room environment, evaporation from surgical incisions, and conductive cooling produced by administration of relatively cool intravenous fluids can result in unintended perioperative hypothermia. Anesthesia-induced hypothermia may alter physiological mechanisms of thermoregulation and may lead to prolonged duration of drug action, myocardial ischemia, coagulopathies, decreased resistance to surgical wound infections, and prolonged recovery time. Unless active warming measures are taken, the patient will lose body heat and endure hypothermic consequences. Therefore, proactive warming measures are needed to prevent excessive heat loss from the patient to the environment. The goal of any warming device is to prevent intraoperative hypothermia or treat preexisting hypothermia. The efficacy of three active warming devices (T/pump circulating water, Bair Hugger, and Thermal-V) that may be used alone or in combination to minimize intraoperative hypothermia when applied to patients undergoing prolonged surgeries were evaluated. Our hypothesis was that the Thermal-V warming unit would be comparable or better than the other units. There were no statistically significant differences between patient temperatures for each warming device in surgeries that lasted 180 minutes. The combined circulating water blanket and forced air warming system and forced air warming device used alone were significantly better in preventing excessive heat loss in patients undergoing celiotomies. The Thermal-V unit was able to prevent excessive heat loss in patients undergoing surgeries up to 150 minutes. Mean patient weight, body condition score, ASA status, and duration of surgical procedures did not have any significant effect on the outcome. Ambient operating room temperature, pre-operative temperature, temperature at time of induction, and temperature at time of sterile preparation did not have any significant effect on the results either. Given some of the drawbacks with other warming systems, the Thermal-V offers an alternative method of active warming with advantages in terms of cost and application to a wide variety of surgical procedures."],

The purpose of this study was to explore the structural relationship among the five factors and to compare the different level of perceptions and commitment between part-time employees of chain restaurants and part-time employees of independent restaurants. A questionnaire survey was conducted to collect the data and a convenience sampling was used. Data analysis contained descriptive analysis, independent samples t-test, and structural equation modeling. First, the findings proved that part-time employees wanted to show their organizational commitment, citizenship behavior, and job satisfaction once they perceived positive organizational and supervisory support. Based on the findings, restaurant operators could consider paying more attention to, and showing more concern for, part-time employees in order to meet their expectations. Second, some attributes of the perceptions of organization and supervisor support, and organizational commitment showed significant differences depending upon whether a part-time employee worked for chain or an independent restaurant. These three factors (perceptions of organization and supervisor support, and organization commitment) showed higher level on part-time employees working at chain restaurants than those at independent restaurants. Therefore, building a mechanistic management system could be a possible way to improve part-time employees' perceptions toward the restaurants and increase their commitment. In sum, restaurant operators could make some changes in order to reduce the turnover rate and save some personnel expenses."],

      abstract: ["At the beginning of the twenty-first century, biological control will be an alternative way to assist the development of agriculture. Biotechnology has been improving during the present decade; specifically, a great deal of information on molecular biology and interaction between host and pathogen has been acquired. Recently, some bacterial biocontrol agents have been commercially introduced, but this field of investigation cannot compete with the development of numerous pesticides because the performance for biocontrol agents is still inadequate for substitution of chemical control. Therefore, it will be a remarkable achievement if biocontrol agents can be substituted for hazardous, synthetic chemicals which damage the natural environment. For this reason, the attempts to introduce a new biocontrol agent will be beneficial to agriculture as well as the environment. The purpose of this research is to investigate the potential of Pseudomonas cepacia as a biocontrol agent, to study the P. cepacia I host I pathogen interaction, and to investigate factors involved in the enhancement of biocontrol to protect crops from soilborne diseases. The literature review looks at the previous and present investigations conducted on P. cepacia as biocontrol agent. Moreover, the review surveys similar aspects of closely related species of Pseudomonas. The focus of discussion is the phytopathogenic strains; however, some aspects of clinical and industrial strains of P. cepacia are mentioned in order to develop key points about the possible hazard to human health and the environment. Since the detection, identification, and pathogenicity of ammonia produced by P. cepacia will not be discussed in the literature chapter, additional information comparing this bacterium to other microorganisms producing ammonia during pathogenic interactions will be discussed. It is intended that'this effort find a convincing answer to the main question of whether or not P. cepacia is a beneficial or deleterious organism."],

The difference in economic impacts between conventional grown and coffee grown organically and marketed as Fair Trade has not been determined. The purpose of this research is to investigate the social-economic impacts of both Fair Trade and organically certified coffee and traditionally produced commercial coffee. The research focuses on measuring the financial impacts on small-medium scale producers and the contribution of organic production practices to sustainable development in Laos. The investigations of impacts were accomplished through interviews and field study of coffee producers on the Bolaven Plateau, mainly in the Paksong district. Both certified and non-certified coffee production has contributed to the local economies. For those families that are directly involved in coffee production, household income has more than doubled. For those who are not farmers, the coffee sector has provided employment opportunities and increased economic activity, particularly through the promotion of the agro-ecotourism industry and the establishment coffee shops. Empirical results suggest that the financial performance of both the organic, free trade coffee and the non-organic coffee is positive. The organic and Fair Trade farmers were found to be slightly more profitable than the non-organic farmers. The results also indicate that to enhance profitability farmers need to focus on increasing yield as high as possible and improving coffee quality."],

      abstract: ["Microcontact printing is a method that utilizes a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamp to pattern extracellular matrix (ECM) onto a substrate which can be used to adhere to biological substances such as proteins and cells. This technique is effective for studying, maintaining, and isolating biological variables. Specifically, it has been used for creating neural networks and understanding cell adhesion and differentiation. Stamps are often reinked with the ECM substrate before each use, a time-consuming process. Others continue to reuse the stamp without reinking to shorten the process. Thus, it is necessary to understand the effects that stamping without reinking has on cell adherence. This was investigated by fabricating three replicate PDMS stamps using the columns on pennies as a mold. Each stamp was used to stamp gelatin into three separate well plates without reinking the gelatin between uses. Cells were then seeded onto the stamped ECM and fixed after 24 hours. The cell cytoskeletons were dyed with a DAPI/TRITC-phalloidin/ PBST-T solution and imaged using a fluorescent microscope where the cell adhesion was quantified by calculating the confluency using ImageJ software. There was no statistical difference between the cell adhesion of stamps and the number of repeated uses. However, stamp 1 had cell adhesion for each repeated use with higher confluency values and the other stamps had little or no cell adhesion. Small sample size and variability in the stamps during fabrication could have led to insignificant statistical results. A larger sample size and high-quality stamps in future iterations could statistically support that cell adhesion decreases as the stamp is used repeatedly without reinking. Thus, it is necessary to reink the stamp before each use when using it in applications such as studying cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation."],

Between the understanding of how nanomedicine can be used in cancer therapies, and the needs of a polymer to deliver drugs to targeted organs and cells, nanopolymers are being used in this field to increase the efficacy of cancer treatments. To use an effective treatment, there must first be an understanding of the inefficiencies of the conventional approaches such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery. The properties of an efficient nanopolymer can then be addressed in its degradation properties, bioactivity, bioavailability, biocompatibility, and targeting mechanisms. The use of polymeric micelles, carbon nanotubes, liposomes, dendrimers, etc. have been used in nanomedicine as effective polymers for drug delivery. Modifying these polymers as in PLGA, PEG, and other inorganic polymers has created an environment optimal for loading drugs and incorporating them into cancerous cells. Testing the use of these polymers has decreased the toxicity of the drug therapy and increased the efficiency of nanopolymer treatments. The discussion of the use of polymers in cancer drug delivery and the types of polymers leads to the conclusion that nanopolymers are increasingly being used for cancer therapy and finding significant results in their efficacy. Increasing use of drugs such as paclitaxel loaded into one of the nanopolymers previously mentioned is becoming a method of cancer therapy worth incorporating into practice due to the efficiencies of this cancer treatment."],

      abstract: ["Total hip and knee arthroplasty (THA and TKA) represent two of the most successful operations in orthopedics. For a total hip or knee prosthesis to function successfully, it must transfer mechanical loads up to seven times the individual’s body weight from the axial skeleton to the lower extremities with minimal friction and wear. This is achieved by constructing prostheses from integrated components of different mechanical properties: a shock-absorbing and low-friction interface between the native joint and implant; a harder and stronger piece supporting the deformable interface, and an anchor securing the implant and transferring loads to the native bone. As early as the 1960s, polymers such as ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) were known to perform successfully at the joint-implant interface. Both ceramics and metals have historically been used for the main support of the implant, although metals and especially titanium alloys have taken preference in recent years. Recently, a flood of innovations has allowed material scientists to maximize the mechanical properties of these materials to increase mechanical strength, adjust elasticity, and improve biocompatibility. These innovations include the development of metal alloys and ceramic composites, reinforcement with carbon nanotubes and hydroxyapatite, antioxidant doping, gamma radiation-induced crosslinking, and bioactive coatings. Today, not only the mechanical properties but also the wear resistance and osseointegration of total hip and knee implants are far improved. This has led to better mechanical and physiological integration of the implants with the body and the necessary durability for younger patients’ more active lifestyles. In this paper, these innovations will be explored within the framework of implant mechanics to provide a comparative assessment of current materials’ mechanical capabilities, advantages, and disadvantages."],

Previous studies investigating this relationship, however, primarily examine the relationship between constraints and idea generation. The present effort aimed to add to our understanding of this relationship by examining the role of constraints at the process level. Approximately 300 undergraduate students completed an experimental task in which the type, number, and timing of constraints were manipulated. All participants engaged in four processes: problem identification, conceptual combination, idea generation, and idea evaluation prior to developing a final solution. Each process and the final proposal were coded and used as dependent variables in the analysis. Results suggest that introducing constraints prior to problem identification improves creative performance on final proposals and that constraints encourage engagement in evaluative processing. Findings regarding effects of types and amount of constraints on specific processes, as well as the implications of these results, are discussed."],

Far from the early and easy passage many Americans envisioned for the amendment, the ERA brought to the nation a ten year struggle between activists who invested ratification with two differing ideological and personal meanings.  For feminists, ratification would guarantee for American women two long denied principles of the Constitution - equality and justice.  For antiratificationists, the amendment would disrupt accepted cultural norms of the day and would continue the dissolution and destruction of the traditional beliefs they held dear, striking at the heart of the nation's founding doctrines.  As the first state to deny ratification, Oklahoma became a battleground between those two factions from the moment Congress sent the amendment to the states.  Caught between the two sides, politicians used compromise, concession, and avoidance of the issue to negotiate the political dilemma of the ERA and to save their political careers.  By the latter years of the decade, the struggle over ratification had politicized large numbers of female state Christian ERA opponents, which helped lead to the Oklahoma political realignment from Democrat to Republican.  As founding members of the Pro Family, Religious Right movement, Oklahoma and other states' anti-ERA Christian women helped initiate, and provided one primary element of, the conservative movement influencing national politics beginning in the 1980s."],

It is fed by the Magdalena River, which drains the northern Andean Cordillera. Integration of multibeam bathymetry, GLORIA side scan sonar and 2D seismic profiles reveal a series of seafloor deepwater channel-levee systems and mass transport complexes (MTCs) that have evolved as a result of changes in the processes controlling the sedimentation. This study explains the fan evolution during the Pleistocene up to present times and how the tectonic setting has modified the morphology of different architectural elements and their depositional styles.",
        "The river delta migrated westward during Pleistocene to Holocene times, generating eight phases in the submarine fan, mainly represented by channel-levee complexes, unconfined deposits and MTCs filling the interchannel lows.  A major Late Pleistocene shift towards the east defined the western abandonment phase of the main fan area (Galerazamba).",
        "The present day fan is located north of the river mouth, revealing its recent activity by deposition of sediment gravity flows which have ruptured submarine cables. Two flow pathways trend down slope through piggyback basins that are linked by knickpoints and canyons. A third flow pathway corresponding to the Aguja Canyon, located northeast of the river mouth, also provided sediment gravity flows which ruptured submarine cables. The flow events are related to different processes on the continental shelf: 1) High flood stages of the river, 2) coastal erosion, 3) longshore drift, 4) hyperpycnal flows and 5) river mouth instability. The sedimentological characteristics of the different deposits should vary because the flow properties are different. Flows through the active Magdalena Canyon and western gullies may be related to high flood stages of the river, giving rise to hyperpycnal flows and instability of the Magdalena delta front. Meanwhile, flows from the Aguja and Sabanilla canyons are associated with longshore drift and coastal erosion.",
        "Mass transport processes have smoothed sea bottom morphology and have been subdivided according to the following causal mechanisms: 1) detached (growth of thrust structures, instability of slope canyon and channel walls) and shelf-attached (major slope failures).",
        "Deformation of the Magdalena Fan occurs at the proximities of the deformation fronts, where buried folds and faults modified the slope. This was recorded in the western fan by increase of sinuosity of the channel-levee systems, forced migration (avulsion) and generation of knickpoints at the higher slope section. Higher slope angles occur at the upper slope, along the northeastern section of the fan, where retrogradational erosion is linked with MTCs as a result of uplift of the inner thrust ridges and the shelf.",
        "Depositional styles vary from the fan to the deformation fronts. Channel-levee systems, unconfined flows and MTCs are typical on the main fan, while thrust deformed areas are dominated by above-slope deposition, represented by unconfined deposits that fill the piggyback basins or are transported downslope to the abyssal plain.",

Using panel data allows me to resolve some of the econometric problems with cross-section studies. Further my treatment of state ownership is unique in the literature.",
        "This paper incorporates the effect of the state in a theoretical model for the cost of capital. The mathematical results show why it might be possible for some degree of state ownership to be efficient under poor investor protection and weak institutions. I introduce the source of inefficiency through the decision of the manager to divert resources from the firm due to poor legal preventive mechanisms. Further, I claim that under some degree of state ownership it is more costly for the manager to steal, because he might be compelled to share benefits with the politicians or it might be too costly to hide from them. Additionally the politicians impose a degree of over-employment on the firm to secure votes, which leads to a decrease in company profits. Consequently, state ownership acts as a monitoring mechanism that limits diversion but imposes a cost. When the manager makes the decision to finance investment with new equity, he has to signal to the market---characterized by poor investor protection---his commitment to limit diversion by retaining some share ownership for himself. In this way he cannot diversify his idiosyncratic risk and assigns a higher cost of capital than the optimal rate assigned by the market. Ultimately diversion and over-employment result in higher cost of capital and passing up profitable investment opportunities. Interestingly in some cases the cost of capital might be reduced when the state owns part of the company. This happens under very poor investor protection when the managers would otherwise choose very high levels of diversion, they limit stealing due to their own share ownership, as well as due to state ownership."],

      abstract: ["Prior research has identified a core set of early and late processes that make up creative problem-solving. Additionally, researchers have highlighted certain skills that further bolster creative output. The importance of one such skill, forecasting, has been observed many times in prior studies. However, these studies tend to observe forecasting in late stages of creativity. Little is known about how forecasting functions if it is carried out earlier in the creative problem-solving process. Along similar lines relatively little is known about how positive and negative valence of forecasts function when carried out early in the process of creative cognition. In the present study, 267 undergraduates were asked to take on the role of a restaurant development consultant and to develop a plan for a new restaurant concept. Participants responded to prompts which primed each stage of the creative problem-solving process before coming up with a final plan for a new restaurant. Manipulations were embedded into the prompts to alter valence and timeframe of their forecasts. It was found that thinking in terms of long-term or both long-term and short-term consequences is beneficial to creative problem solving. Additionally, a positive valence of forecasts was seen to be beneficial to certain creative processes, however for a higher quality, more original, and more elegant final product, a negative valence was seen to be critical. The implications of these findings for understanding forecasting and creative problem solving are discussed."],

The sources reviewed include an analysis of Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC), books, articles, journals, websites, and dissertations. Literature directly addressing educators' attitudes towards the integration of electronic grading software into schools was found to be scant and virtually non-existent. Therefore, the literature obtained addresses with attitudes towards technology and/or computers. Based on the literature reviewed, it is apparent that years of computer experience, and years of teaching experience do have an impact on attitudes. It was also discovered in the literature that administrators' attitudes do impact teachers' attitudes.",

The results might supply school districts with information to consider before, during, and while actively integrating electronic grading software into their district.",
        "The results obtained in this study appear to remain consistent with the trends set forth in the literature review. Years of computer experience and years of teaching experience were found to be statistically significant predictors of educators' attitudes. Interestingly, years of teaching experience and age (even though not statistically significant) both displayed a negative regression coefficient. The correlation analysis to determine if there was any significant relationship between teacher and administrator attitudes revealed that district 1 had no statistically significant correlation where district 2 and the entire sample did show a relatively strong correlation. The correlation analysis also reported a low variance accounted for with both variables which may suggest that there are other factors such as, but limited to past experiences, training, computer dependability or computer availability in existence which may affect educator attitudes."],

The first essay, \"Government Revenue Maximization, External Capital and Corporate Diversification, \" examines the argument that firms that have easy access to external capital, which is directly related to government subsidies in Korea, become over-diversified. The empirical analysis shows that firms with a high debt level are the most likely to pursue diversified expansion. Furthermore, this study shows that these firms have a tendency to decrease their diversification level when the government reduces business subsidies. The analysis conducted here is consistent with the argument that extensive and skewed subsidies lead industrial firms to accumulate considerable resources that are a springboard for excessive diversification.",
        "The second essay, entitled, \"Chaebol Structure and Industry Productivity Growth in Korea, \" focuses on the effects of corporate diversification on performance rather than any particular aim that lies behind diversification strategies. According to prevailing studies, the over-diversification of Korea's large business conglomerates was an important source of inefficiency, which resulted in an industrial structure that was particularly susceptible to the financial shocks of the 1990s. My empirical tests are consistent with this argument, as they show that industries with higher levels of chaebol diversification have lower levels of productivity and productivity growth. These findings are consistent with previous studies in other countries, which have found that diversification is negatively related to economic performance."],

      abstract: ["Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) are a dominant climatological feature of the central United States and are responsible for a substantial fraction of warm season rainfall.  Yet, very little is known about the predictability of MCSs.  To help address this situation, a series of ensemble simulations of a MCS are performed using two- and three-dimensional versions of a storm-scale (&#916;x = 1 km) model and compared with an idealized control run.  Ensemble member perturbations in wind speed, relative humidity and convective instability are based on current 24-h forecast errors from the North American Model (NAM).  The ensemble results thus provide an upper bound on the predictability of mesoscale convective systems within realistic estimates of environmental uncertainty, assuming successful convective initiation.",
        "The two-dimensional simulations are assessed by considering an ensemble member a success when it reproduces a convective system of at least 20 km in length (roughly the size of two convective cells) within 100 km on either side of the location of the MCS in the control run.  By that standard, MCSs occur roughly 70% of the time for perturbation magnitudes consistent with 24-h forecast errors.   Reducing the perturbations for all fields to one-half the 24-h error values increases the MCS forecast success rate to over 90%.  The same improvement in forecast accuracy leads to a 30-40% reduction in maximum surface wind speed uncertainty, a roughly 20% reduction in the uncertainty in maximum updraft strength, and initially slower growth in the uncertainty in the size of the MCS.  However, the occurrence of MCSs drops below 50% as the mid-layer mean relative humidity falls below 65%.  The response of the model to reductions in forecast errors for convective instability, moisture, and wind speed is not consistent and cannot easily be generalized, but each perturbation type is found to have a substantial impact on forecast uncertainty.",
        "Results from the three-dimensional simulations resemble those found in two dimensions.  The MCS success rate for the three-dimensional runs is around 70% for perturbation magnitudes consistent with 24-h forecast errors, while reducing the initial uncertainty improves the success rate to nearly 85%.  The maximum updraft and surface wind uncertainties are of similar magnitude to their two-dimensional counterparts.  However, whereas the response of the model to improvements in the initial uncertainty is inconsistent in the two-dimensional experiment, it is non-existent in three-dimensions.  For most storm features, improvement in the forecast uncertainty requires the reduction of initial uncertainty for all three of the fields together.  The three-dimensional runs often produce solutions that resemble bow echoes, but surface winds associated with these solutions, and the perturbation profiles that produce them, are indistinguishable from the non-bowing solutions, making any conclusions about the bow-like systems difficult."],

Previous research has identified that women in some regions of the world, home to the norms and beliefs commonly termed a “culture of honor,” experience more sexual assaults and less support in the face of such an experience. This trend indicates that men who endorse the ideology of a culture of honor are more likely to sexually objectify, and potentially assault, women. The purpose of this research is to establish the relationship between honor ideology and sexual objectification, as well as investigate potential mediators of that relationship. Three studies were run examining these variables from self-report data obtained from college (Studies 1 and 2) and Amazon Mechanical Turk (Study 3) samples. Study 1 established that there is a positive relationship between honor ideology and sexual objectification, and that sexual objectification mediates the relationship between honor ideology and attitudes about sexual violence toward women. Studies 2 and 3 explored potential mediators of the link between honor ideology and sexual objectification. Study 2 examined patriarchal beliefs alone as a potential mediator, while Study 3 looked at the relative mediating effects of patriarchal beliefs and concern for reputation in the same model. Study 2 and 3 established that patriarchal beliefs significantly mediates the relationship between honor ideology and sexual objectification, even when the effect of concern for reputation is considered. Study 3 indicated that concern for reputation does not significantly mediate the relationship between honor ideology and sexual objectification when the effect of patriarchal beliefs is considered."],

I have also studied possible effects of progenitor evolution on the spectra of Type Ia supernovae. I have modified the heavy element content of the unburned material and studied the effects on the spectra. I found that primordial metals are important to line formation in early spectra. I have also mixed hydrogen rich material into the outer atmospheres of Type Ia supernovae and found that hydrogen must be at least one-tenth of the mass of the outer envelope to affect spectra at 10 days after explosion.

Past studies have provided conflicting interpretations of the role that lightning plays in forecasting tropical cyclone (TC) intensity changes. With the goal of improving the usefulness of total lightning, detailed case studies were conducted of five TCs that underwent rapid intensification (RI) within the domains of two unique ground-based long-range lightning detection networks, the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) and Earth Networks Total Lightning Network (ENTLN). This analysis will provide greater details of the distribution of lightning within predefined storm features to highlight specific phenomena that large statistical studies cannot resolve.",

For the cases examined, a maxima in eyewall lightning was located downshear and in the front-right quadrants relative to storm motion. Results show that RI follows a burst of lightning in the eyewall when coinciding with a period of little environmental vertical shear. Eyewall lightning would cycle with greater frequency during intensification compared to weakening. Bursts of lightning were observed in the eyewall just prior to eye formation in both the infrared and microwave imagery. Eyewall lightning bursts in low shear environments could be used to indicate intensification and improve forecasts.",

      abstract: ["Reinforcement learning depends on agents being learning individuals, and when agents rely on their instincts rather than gathering data and acting accordingly, the population tends to be less successful than a true RL population. \"Riskiness\" is the elementary metric for determining how willing to rely on learning an individual or a population is. With a high learning parameter, as we denote riskiness in this paper, agents find the safest option and seldom deviate from it, essentially using learning to become a non-learning individual. With a low learning rate, agents ignore recency entirely and seek out the highest reward, regardless of the risk. We attempt in this paper to evolve this \"risk neutrality\" in a population by adding a safe exploration nurturing period during which agents are free to explore without consequence. We discovered the environmental conditions necessary for our hypotheses to be mostly satisfied and found that nurturing enables agents to distinguish between two different risky options to evolve risk neutrality. Too long of a nurturing period causes the evolution to waver before settling on a path with essentially random results, while a short nurturing period causes a successful evolution of risk neutrality. The non-nurturing case evolves risk aversion by default as we expected from a reinforcement learning system, because agents are unable to distinguish between the good risk and bad risk, so they decide to avoid risks altogether.",

Many of Charles Darwin’s contemporaries interpreted his theory of natural selection as evidence of competition ruling nature. Science writer and popularizer Arabella Buckley was the first to characterize Darwin’s theory of the evolution of morals as mutualistic rather than materialistic, and she did so through a unique consolidation of evolutionary epic and spiritualism. While scholars have stressed Buckley’s contribution to the evolutionary narrative as either driven by a maternal tradition or motivated by her spiritualistic beliefs, I aim to show that the significance of her distinctive, mutualistic addition to the debate on the evolution of morals lies in her unifying theory of traducianism.",

Seventy-five percent of nicotine is metabolized into cotinine, and with the growing prevalence of nicotine-related deaths comes the increased possibility of finding nicotine or cotinine in the tissues of a corpse and thus the possibility of distorting the postmortem interval (PMI). Through entomotoxicology, the study of how drugs and toxins influence the development of insects present on a decomposing body, this experiment aimed to determine if varying levels of nicotine and cotinine affect the development of the forensically important Cochliomyia macellaria (Fabricius) [Diptera: Calliphoridae]. In this experiment, C. macellaria maggots were reared on seven varying concentrations of nicotine and cotinine and were sampled every eight hours. Length, weight and accumulated degree hours were then measured or determined. Our study found that maggots reared on lethal nicotine and lethal cotinine showed a significant decrease in length and weight as well as a delay in development time for the second instar life stage. These results suggest a relationship between high concentrations of nicotine and cotinine and the development of C. macellaria, which could greatly affect PMI estimations.",

The discrete magnetic Laplace operator LσG, a second-order difference operator for complex-valued functions on the vertices of G, has been an interesting and useful tool in discrete analysis for over twenty years. Its role in the study of quantum mechanics has been examined closely since its debut in a classic paper by Lieb and Loss in 1993. In this paper, we pose some boundary value problems associated to this operator, and adapt two classic techniques to the setting of magnetic graphs to solve them. The first technique uses the spectral properties of the operator, and the second technique utilizes random walks adjusted to this particular setting. Throughout, we will prove some useful results including a Green’s identity, mean value characterization of harmonic functions, and extensions of the solution techniques to Kronecker product graphs.",

      abstract: ["In 2012, Google introduced the Knowledge Graph, a computer system that instead of providing search results, provides information—what Google calls “knowledge.”  Now, when people go to Google and search for “Leonardo da Vinci,” they see a little box pop up next to the traditional search results, outlining da Vinci’s vocation, his birth date, his siblings, his artworks, and so on.  While a good deal of work has been done on the broader ethical implications of Google in general (“Search Engines and Ethics”), less has been done on the epistemological implications on the Knowledge Graph in particular—how does the Knowledge Graph affect the landscape of what can be known, and how does it change cultural assumptions about the nature of knowledge?  Alexander Monea, in a 2016 paper, made strong headway into the topic.  Examining the Knowledge Graph, he argued that “the fundamental data structure of the ‘triple,’ in essence a subject-predicate-object statement, constitutes a problem immanent to the database itself”.  Using the “perspective of media theory, philosophy of difference, and epistemology”, he demonstrated that the “structure of the ‘triple’” sets certain limits on the types of knowledge that graph databases can represent.  Taking his work as a starting point, and looking towards speech act theory and Mary Poovey’s A History of the Modern Fact for theoretical support, I argue that the Knowledge Graph is predicated on specific epistemological assumptions unique to the past five-hundred years or so, assumptions that take it on faith that knowledge consists of facts that can “exist in the world like pebbles, waiting to be picked up”.  Furthermore, I contend that the Knowledge Graph, through Michel Foucault’s notion of the “will to truth,” limits what we can know by promoting a narrow definition of “the true discourse”.",

In this paper, I argue that the nationalist movement in Quebec utilized the terminology and ideology of the decolonization movements in both Algeria and the Caribbean in order to legitimize their rapprochement with France. In a break from the past, nationalists in the Era of Decolonization began to argue that they had been colonized unfairly by the British— despite the fact that they were themselves colonizers of the North American territory— and thus had suffered at the hands of their colonizers, just as other Third World peoples had at the hands of other European powers. This argument, in turn, legitimized the nascent nationalist movement, and permitted both the Quebecois and the broader international community to at least tacitly accept the clear, pro-nationalist actions taken by the French on behalf of the Quebecois starting with de Gaulle’s “Vive le Quebec Libre” speech of 1967.",

Current debates over the legality of abortion rely on its religious characterization as an act of murder, a lingering stamp of ill fame from Europe’s medieval past.\r\nRemarkably, however, early medieval abortion laws were in some cases ambivalent toward early-term abortions (Elsakkers, “Abortion, Poisoning, Magic, and Contraception” 101). Frankish legal codes punished abortion as a poison, Frisian laws used a “hair and nails” criterion for abortion, and Old Germanic laws punished abortion more strongly for a male fetus. Intentional abortion went virtually unmentioned in Old Germanic law (Elsakkers, “Reading Between the Lines” 465). The Roman Catholic Church, by contrast, concentrated almost exclusively on intentional abortion. Church law vigorously denounced abortion as murder and warned women that they would be punished with “spiritual death,” excommunication, and hell if they obtained an abortion at any point in a pregnancy (Elsakkers, “Reading Between the Lines” 468). As the Middle Ages progressed, secular law began to echo these grim denunciations more and more frequently. The parallel development of the legal concept of criminalization and the religious concept of ensoulment at conception made possible the transfer of the Church’s condemnation of abortion into secular law.",

The study found differences between genders of the types of crimes committed and between those who have and have not been abused. Those who have been abused have greater odds of showing deviant behaviors than those who have not, and males have higher odds of both committing violent offenses and using hard drugs than females. When examining the findings, there is a much larger gap between the genders on violent offenses than on drug use.",

The lack of research done on women of the period can be mostly attributed to the scarcity of information available. One cause of this lack of material is the political and religious climate of Safavid Iran, which naturally lent to Muslim historiographers chronicling a masculine view of history.

      abstract: ["The post-Revolutionary American woman was idealized as an embodiment of virtue, heralded for fulfilling her duties to family and society, but kept well outside of politics, academia, and other traditionally masculine environments. And yet the ideals of the American Revolution were seated in the concept of rights as natural and inalienable, as devices that granted the power specifically to challenge exclusion from government. This social contract theory, most famously expressed by John Locke in the late seventeenth century, held that members of society traded some personal freedoms in exchange for government protection of life, liberty, and property, thus stressing the importance of personal duties as well as personal autonomy.  However, Americans’ focus during the Revolution fell more heavily on the latter, emphasizing man’s individual liberties, and more specifically, his political liberties, as the essence of natural rights.  In contrast, women’s natural rights were conceptualized in accord with theory originating from the Scottish Enlightenment shortly before the American Revolution. In this view, rights were benefits conferred by God, with necessary duties attached, and these rights and duties became indistinguishable.  While the Lockean conceptualization of natural rights found its place at the very heart of the American Revolution, writings from the later eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries demonstrate how the Scottish theory of natural rights was differentially applied to women, equating their rights with duties and thus justifying the denial of the same natural rights as men."],

Although many slave narratives and journals address female rape and other forms of sexual assault, the abuse endured by male slaves has been grossly overlooked. The intention of this paper is not to discredit the suffering of female slaves, but the research suggested that the same use of sexual assault as a form of discipline and control was applied to male slaves. There is a general consensus that only women were subjected to the violently lustful assaults of slave owners. A closer analysis of the narratives of Olaudah Equiano, Harriet Jacobs, and Frederick Douglas revealed the underlying issue that male slaves were going through similar situations.

While this signature only took a moment, consequences of it would change the Cherokee nation forever. Even before the Act was signed into law strong opinions on it were rampant among both American citizens and tribal members. Residents of Georgia wanted the entirety of the land in their state ceded to them; they did not see their native neighbors as friends or equals, though they were considered one of the five “civilized” tribes. The idea of Manifest Destiny aided the American opinion that they were entitled to this land despite the fact it was home to Natives. Following the legislation, many Cherokees were divided on how to proceed. This created factions within the tribe, causing hostilities between them. While a relatively small percentage agreed to make the move, most were insistent on staying in their ancestral lands. Ultimately, the Trail of Tears brought the thousands of Natives who did not agree to move west of the Mississippi involuntarily to new lands, killing many in the process and causing strained relations between the factions that had previously separated. The Indian Removal Act of the 1830s factionalized the Cherokee Nation into the Patriot Party, Treaty Party, and the Old Settlers because of conflicting land disputes in Georgia and Indian Territories."],

DeBarr, for whom it was named, had been a grand dragon in the Ku Klux Klan. Then Oklahoma University President William S. Banowsky considered, and concluded in a Board of Regents meeting that the Chemistry Building should continue to be called DeBarr Hall. Among the president's reasons was this: \"Should he be tried twice for the same shortcoming? After the passing of half a century, it is inappropriate to attempt to re-write history. 'The moving finger writes, and having writ moves on; nor all piety nor wit can lure it back to cancel half a line, nor all your tears wash out a word of it.'\" Although he neglected to attribute the sentiment to Omar Khayyam, that argument might have had merit were it not for the fact that DeBarr was not being tried for the same shortcoming but a completely separate ideological issue that was simply anchored in the same historical event: the Board of Regents asking DeBarr to leave the University of Oklahoma. Two questions present themselves. Why did the Board of Regents fire DeBarr? And, why did the students object to DeBarr's name being used for the chemistry building? Unless those two answers are the same, then President Banowsky's logic in refusing the students' request was flawed. Were the students of 1982 outraged that DeBarr broke with University policy? That he was involved in politics and tried to mobilize his network to elect Robert Wilson as governor? No. They objected to honoring a member of the KKK when the current student body was diverse and opposed to the brutal racism associated with the Klan. DeBarr was never tried in court, but among his peers at the University, and the reasons for his termination in the 20s had nothing to do with racism that the students of the 80s repudiated."],

Thus, the environment was not merely a site of Japanese American incarceration, but an instrument of social control manipulated by the War Relocation Authority (WRA): administrators situated the camps in strategic locations designed to both isolate Japanese Americans and secure their labor in the name of patriotism and the public good.

      abstract: ["In the wake of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the United States not only declared war on the Empire of Japan, but also began the forced relocation of thousands of Japanese American citizens from the Pacific Coast to concentration camps in the inland West. Over the course of the next four years, the experience of Japanese Americans in these camps was characterized not only by scant wages and arduous work weeks, but also by the harsh climate of Western United States. For Japanese Americans uprooted from the balmy Pacific Coast, the hostile alien landscape shaped everything from their mental and physical health to their overall perception of imprisonment, often compounding their feelings of homesickness and anger. Thus, the environment was not merely a site of Japanese American incarceration, but an instrument of social control manipulated by the War Relocation Authority (WRA): administrators situated the camps in strategic locations designed to both isolate Japanese Americans and secure their labor in the name of patriotism and the public good. Thus, Japanese American internment was more than just an atrocious civil rights violation, but an instance of environmental injustice where one group used the natural world as a tool to assert authority over another."],

The urge to fight communism while advocating for democracy meant a dilemma when faced with countries with democratically elected leftist governments. By no means does leftism mean communism, however, during the Cold War, the United States feared that left of center governments could fall to communism with the Soviet Union's influence. Ultimately, the United States was more intent on stopping the spread of communism than supporting true democracies, so it supported military coups against democratically elected leftist governments to put right-wing regimes in their place. The fact that the CIA backed these coups is no longer a secret, and the CIA has even admitted to involvement in some of them. Despite these operations being clandestine at the time, that did not stop the media from subjectively reporting in opposition to these leftist governments, especially Guatemala's. Newspapers in the United States reported with clear bias against the leftist democratically elected government in Guatemala before, during, and after the CIA military coup."],

      abstract: ["The American Civil Rights Movement that in many respects defined the 20th century was itself defined by its leaders. Martin Luther King, Jr., Rosa Parks, and Malcolm X are today household names. While these nationally recognized figures are certainly iconic of the Movement, consider, too, as leaders the African-American physicians of the Civil Rights era. We hold our doctors in high regard and to high standards of moral and just behavior, and it is nothing controversial to consider a physician to be a community leader. With the 20th century issues of segregation both in higher education and in the practice of healthcare in mind, what was the role of African-American physicians as leaders in the Civil Rights Movement of the era? It is easy to imagine that black physicians were bound by the Jim Crow laws in the South and--until federal intervention--were unable to receive a medical education or practice their craft in a desegregated context. However, evidence offered in the form of oral accounts given by African-American physicians working in Texas during the 20th century gives a different perspective. It is revealed that these physicians were at the forefront of their own civil rights effort early after the Second World War. The nature of African-American physician involvement in the Civil Rights Movement and the effect that the Movement had on the lives of these individuals are intertwined. Just as the experiences of African-American physicians in the mid-twentieth century were heavily shaped by the social and political contexts of the era, in turn these physicians helped to shape the social realities in which they worked."],

William Tecumseh Sherman's March to the Sea was a brutal affair, filled with what many Southerners argued to be war crimes; but, these actions can, in truth, be interpreted to have roughly followed today's laws of war, even though they did not yet exist in Sherman's time. War is brutal, dehumanizing, and degrading, and this campaign was simply a product of the time and a necessary evil.

      abstract: ["For a span of one hundred and forty-four years, from the official founding of the country until the passage of the 19th amendment to the Constitution, women in the United States of America did not have the right to vote.  How could a nation which so openly touted the principles of freedom and equality commit such an egregious error as to disenfranchise what comprised nearly half of its “free” population for well over half of its existence?  To answer this question, it becomes necessary to examine the principles which influenced the founders of the nation and further, to explore how those ideas were implemented and sustained in the rapidly evolving milieu of the post-revolutionary republic.  In particular, Aristotelian ideas on public and private virtue and the education necessary for achieving success in those ventures had a dramatic and lasting impact on women’s roles in society that can still be seen today.  In the early Republic, women assumed the role of republican wives, masters and purveyors of virtue in the private sphere, intended to shore up and complement their virtuous male counterparts in the public sphere.  Over time, women began to see themselves less as counterparts to their husbands and more as equals.  This led to an increased demand from women for equality in education and exposure to the public realm previously reserved for men, causing the lines between the public and private spheres to become eroded.  It was believed that the success of the republic depended on whether or not virtue could be achieved in both the public and private spheres, but that these realms should remain clearly delineated and controlled by their respectively assigned caretakers.  Counter-current to women’s push for equality in the public sphere through education in their role as wives ran the idea that women better served the republic by remaining in the private sphere and being educated as mothers."],

Openly gay and lesbian communities felt empowered by these movements and began advocating for their own equal rights, consolidated self-esteem, and group consciousness. Out of these existing queer communities, the Gay Peoples Union, a student-led organization at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, emerged and championed gay activism. This paper argues that while many queer organizations claimed the mantle of revolutionary sexual struggle, none embodied the gay liberation movement like the Gay Peoples Union as they utilized both mainstream and alternative media outlets to combat systemic oppression, promote political engagement, and destigmatize homosexuality. This paper uses primary sources from the Gay Peoples Union’s newspaper publications and radio program as well as secondary sources examining the gay liberation movement as a whole from different historians to serve as historical evidence."],

These booms also created competition among companies, therefore leading to the aggressive use of advertisements which reinforced certain “American” ideals in order to sell products.

Advertisements during the mid-twentieth century preyed upon the uncertainty among citizens pertaining to their American citizenship, and illustrated companies’ desire to appeal to a specifically white, middle-class audience. They emphasized the “American” ideals of happily married couples, healthy families and babies, and cleanliness. The “scientific” claims that many companies, such as Listerine, used in their advertisements have since been proven by modern science as false, however, the ads share an overarching theme of only targeting and portraying white, happy people. Ideals embedded by advertisements during the mid-twentieth century heavily influenced American stereotypes and served as distractions from difficult times. By using the uncertainty regarding the definition of “Americanism,” companies relied on images and the psychological aspects of their advertisements to sell their products. In the process, they defined the stereotypical qualities that embodied the term “American,” many of which still exist today."],

With that in mind, young LGBT people are increasingly turning to formal institutions to educate them, but one particular chapter is all too often overlooked. As a result, this chapter, called the gay liberation movement, deserves a renewed consideration.

      abstract: ["Punctuated, mass mortality events are increasing for many animal taxa and are often related to climatic extremes such as drought. Freshwater mussels are experiencing increased mass mortality events linked to hydrologic drought. Because mussels play important functional roles in rivers it is important to understand the ecosystem effects of these die-offs. Here, we address how mass mortality events of mussels caused by drought may impact stream ecosystem function. We first present a conceptual model, based on the literature, of how mussel mass mortality should affect different ecosystem functions across various ecological time scales, from hours to decades. Next, we highlight two case studies of drought-linked, mussel-mass mortality events from rivers in the southern U.S. We then present the results of an experiment we performed quantifying the ecosystem effects of a punctuated mussel die-off. Finally, we combine our experimental results with field data from a recent mussel die-off to predict how mussel losses will influence ecosystem function. Based on the presented case studies, our mesocosm experiment, and our extrapolated nutrient pulse due to a mussel die-off, we conclude that stream ecosystems are extensively altered following mussel mass mortality events. Mussel loss is governed by drought severity, location within the river network, and species-specific drought tolerances. In the short term, decomposing carrion from mussel die-offs releases a large pulse of nutrients into the water which stimulates food web productivity. In the long term, the overall loss of mussel biomass, and the loss of functional traits as more sensitive species decline, leads to decreases in ecosystem function which may take decades to recover. Drought and human demand for water will make mussel die-offs more likely in the future and it is unlikely that drought sensitive species will recover without changes in water management and restoration of populations through mussel propagation. Our research provides an example of how the loss of an abundant, long-lived organism has cascading and long-term impacts on ecosystems."],

Determining the CPU resource availability of a multi-core architecture based on the characteristics of the threads that are in execution is the art of system performance prediction. Prediction of CPU resource availability is important in the context of making process assignment, load balancing, and scheduling decisions. In distributed infrastructure, CPU resources are allocated on demand for a chosen set of compute nodes. In this paper, a prediction model is derived for multi-core architectures and empirical evaluations are performed with real-world benchmark programs in a heterogeneous environment to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed model.

      abstract: ["In Estonian, some objects of verbs show an alternation in case-marking that seems to be conditioned by morphological number: genitive when singular, nominative when plural. According to traditional descriptions (Erelt et al. 1993, 2000) and some recent research (Miljan & Cann 2013), these objects are genitive/nominative syntactically and morphologically. This paper argues against this approach, proposing instead that these cases are the morphological realization of a non-autonomous syntactic accusative case, on the basis of two novel arguments. First, although isolated words in the language have no unique accusative form, the pseudopartitive construction does exhibit a unique form in would-be accusative contexts. Second, the genitive form of the inanimate relative pronoun (mille) can be replaced by nominative/unmarked mis, but only when it is in an object position. Though it has been proposed in the literature that Estonian has an accusative case (Hiietam 2003, 2005, Caha 2009), neither of these arguments has been discussed, and they provide compelling morphosyntactic evidence in favor of the proposal. Possible paths to an analysis of the accusative’s pervasive syncretism are discussed in the framework of Distributed Morphology. It is proposed that an analysis making use of Impoverishment is superior to one without. The investigation here constitutes an additional case study in the divide between syntactic case and morphological case (Deal 2016, Goddard 1982, Legate 2008, 2014, Spencer 2006)."],

Second, we demonstrate that both distributive and partisan theories of legislative organization are applicable to the distribution of earmarks. Finally, we present results indicating that contrary to the conventional wisdom, most subcommittees do not distribute pork based on electoral vulnerability.

We showed that by applying a 40 kHz ultrasound frequency over a 20-second exposure, Texas red-conjugated dextran was delivered with 27% efficiency into Thermoanaerobacter sp. X514, a TGPA that can utilize both pentose and hexose for ethanol production. Experiments that delivered plasmids showed that host-cell viability and plasmid DNA integrity were not compromised. Via sonoporation, shuttle vectors pHL015 harboring a jellyfish gfp gene and pIKM2 encoding a Clostridium thermocellum β-1,4-glucanase gene were delivered into X514 with an efficiency of 6×102 transformants/µg of methylated DNA. Delivery into X514 cells was confirmed via detecting the kanamycin-resistance gene for pIKM2, while confirmation of pHL015 was detected by visualization of fluorescence signals of secondary host-cells following a plasmid-rescue experiment. Furthermore, the foreign β-1,4-glucanase gene was functionally expressed in X514, converting the host into a prototypic thermophilic consolidated bioprocessing organism that is not only ethanologenic but cellulolytic.Conclusions/SignificanceIn this study, we developed an ultrasound-based sonoporation method in TGPAs.

      abstract: ["Zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP) has been found to have anticancer activity both in vitro and in vivo. We have recently demonstrated that ZnPP diminishes β-catenin protein expression in cancer cells. The present study examined the cellular mechanisms that mediate ZnPP’s suppression of β-catenin expression. We demonstrate that ZnPP induces a rapid degradation of the β-catenin protein in cancer cells, which is accompanied by a significant inhibition of proteasome activity, suggesting that proteasome degradation does not directly account for the suppression. The possibility that ZnPP induces β-catenin exportation was rejected by the observation that there was no detectable β-catenin protein in the conditioned medium after ZnPP treatment of cancer cells. Further experimentation demonstrated that ZnPP induces lysosome membrane permeabilization, which was reversed by pretreatment with a protein transportation inhibitor cocktail containing Brefeldin A (BFA) and Monensin. More significantly, pretreatment of cancer cells with BFA and Monensin attenuated the ZnPP-induced suppression of β-catenin expression in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, indicating that the lysosome protein degradation pathway is likely involved in the ZnPP-induced suppression of β-catenin expression. Whether there is cross-talk between the ubiquitin-proteasome system and the lysosome pathway that may account for ZnPP-induced β-catenin protein degradation is currently unknown. These findings provide a novel mechanism of ZnPP’s anticancer action and reveal a potential new strategy for targeting the β-catenin Wnt signaling pathway for cancer therapy."],

Yet it is still unclear how this pathogen is able to persist globally. While wild birds seem to be a genetic reservoir for influenza A, they do not seem to be the main source of human illness. Here, we highlight the role that domestic poultry may play in maintaining A/H5N1 globally, using theoretical models of spatial population structure in poultry populations. We find that a metapopulation of moderately sized poultry flocks can sustain the pathogen in a finite poultry population for over two years. Our results suggest that it is possible that moderately intensive backyard farms could sustain the pathogen indefinitely in real systems. This fits a pattern that has been observed from many empirical systems. Rather than just employing standard culling procedures to control the disease, our model suggests ways that poultry production systems may be modified."],

We used a mixed methods research design that consisted of two studies: qualitative followed by quantitative. Study 1 explored stakeholder identities and how they are related to stakeholder development and support of the event, and Study 2 examined how future intentions regarding attendance, donations, and sponsor support differ based on levels of stakeholder identity. Sports marketing and non-profit management literature streams as well as identity theory and social capital theory informed our studies. The National Kidney Foundation Surf Festival was selected because it is a grassroots cause-related sporting event with financial success over the last two decades. In addition, a surf contest, an action sport, is a unique sport setting in the nonprofit sector, which offers insight to marketers seeking to target subcultures. The findings of the qualitative study revealed three identities relevant to participants: sport subculture, community, and cause. A framework emerged from the data that illustrated how these identities unite together to generate social capital, which is linked to effective volunteer and sponsorship management. Quantitative analysis through survey data provided further evidence of the impact of identification with a cause-related sport activity on consumer outcomes. Results indicated attendees with high surf-related identity are more likely to attend future Surf Festivals, have higher intentions to donate to the cause, and have higher sponsor purchase intentions compared to those with low self-identity with the sport subculture. The conclusion discusses implications, framing the findings through the intersection of the sports marketing and non-profit sector industries, and provides suggestions for future research."],

Despite the essential role emotions play in teachers’ lives and instruction, research on teachers’ emotions has not paid much attention on teachers’ emotions in the context of daily teaching. This paper explored elementary teachers’ emotions while preparing for teaching and during teaching mathematics, reasons that underlie these emotions, and the relationship between their emotions and the quality of their mathematics instruction. Participants were seven elementary teachers working in the U.S. who participated in Holistic Individualized Coaching (HIC) professional development that consisted of five cycles of coaching over an year. For each coaching cycle, pre-coaching conversation and post-coaching conversation data were collected regarding emotions teachers felt in anticipation of teaching and during teaching retrospectively. In order to compare teachers’ emotions with instructional quality, coaching sessions were video recorded and analyzed to determine the quality of instruction. Findings of this study showed that teachers reported six categories of emotions (positive, negative, neutral, blended-positive, blended-negative, and mixed), described emotions often in non-typical ways (e.g., “not nervous”, “anxious but in a positive way”), and experienced mixed emotions (co-occcurence of positive and negative emotions) as the most dominant emotion. Teachers also had more positive emotions anticipating teaching than actually teaching the lesson. The reason teachers felt mixed emotions reflected the complex and context-specific nature of teaching, a phenomenon not currently described in the teacher emotion literature. There were no clear relationships between emotional experiences and instructional quality. This study allowed participants to freely describe their authentic, complex, overlapping, and ambiguous emotions in the context of active teaching, which contributes opening up the possibilities of diversifying teacher emotion research and shows the significance and usefulness of understanding teachers’ emotions related to active instruction."],

Chickasaws have held sacred the gift of our living language, passing it from generation to generation for thousands of years. From this understanding of the purpose of Chikashshanompa', I challenge metaphors of language endangerment, loss, and death which pervade academic research. Drawing on research utilizing a culturally-grounded methodology, as well as Chickasaw epistemologies to conceptualize Chikashshanompa' reclamation work, I introduce finger weaving—the traditional Chickasaw art form used to weave sash belts for ceremonial attire—as a culturally-significant and -appropriate metaphor for the process of ensuring language continuance over generations. I identify distinct strands of the weaving as themes emerging from both academic research and personal experience, including: the development of a critical Chickasaw consciousness, an understanding of Chikashshanompa' as cultural practice, and the (re)valuing of language learners. One of the most challenging aspects of finger weaving is ensuring proper tension between strands. To this end, I explore those forces that may also undermine language reclamation, such as persistent and damaging language ideologies. This shift in metaphor and paradigm emphasizes and values the vital roles of Indigenous community members in language research and ongoing reclamation work. Ultimately, I argue that by upholding metaphors for language work which reflect Indigenous epistemologies, we become guided by a sense of hope for the continuance of language."],

The prognosis is worse for wounds with biofilms of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE), and multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDR-PA). Resistance hinders initial treatment of standard-of-care antibiotics. The persistence of MRSA, MRSE, and/or MDR-PA often allows acute infections to become chronic wound infections. The water-soluble hydrophilic properties of low-molecular-weight (600 Da) branched polyethylenimine (600 Da BPEI) enable easy drug delivery to directly attack AMR and biofilms in the wound environment as a topical agent for wound treatment. To mitigate toxicity issues, we have modified 600 Da BPEI with polyethylene glycol (PEG) in a straightforward one-step reaction. The PEG–BPEI molecules disable β-lactam resistance in MRSA, MRSE, and MDR-PA while also having the ability to dissolve established biofilms. PEG-BPEI accomplishes these tasks independently, resulting in a multifunction potentiation agent. We envision wound treatment with antibiotics given topically, orally, or intravenously in which external application of PEG–BPEIs disables biofilms and resistance mechanisms. In the absence of a robust pipeline of new drugs, existing drugs and regimens must be re-evaluated as combination(s) with potentiators. The PEGylation of 600 Da BPEI provides new opportunities to meet this goal with a single compound whose multifunction properties are retained while lowering acute toxicity."],

Also, differences in the rate of concentrated affluence between blacks and whites are explored. Models of concentrated affluence that incorporate variables suggested by the literature on economic restructuring in the late twentieth century and by the literature on racial differences in the residential return to individual resources are developed and tested. In general, variables measuring industry/occupation employment mix influence the rate of concentrated affluence mainly through the levels of income they generate. Racial differences in the rate of concentrated affluence are influenced more by income differences between blacks and whites than by residential segregation."],

Herein, a facile fabrication method is developed using a microwave-based rapid porogen removal technique for the manufacturing of porous nanocomposite sponges consisting of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and well-dispersed carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The porogen amounts and CNT loadings are varied to tailor the porosity and electrical properties of the porous sensors. The sponges are characterized by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to compare their microstructures, validate the high-quality CNT dispersion, and confirm the successful nanofiller embedding within the elastomeric matrix. Sponges with a 3 wt% CNT loading demonstrate the highest piezoresistive sensitivity. Experimental characterization shows that the sponges with low porosity have long durability and minimal strain rate dependence. Additionally, the developed sponges with 3 wt% CNTs are employed for the human motion detection using piezoresistive method. One experiment includes fingertip compression measurements on a prosthetic hand. Moreover, the sensors are attached to the chest, elbow, and knee of a user to detect breathing, running, walking, joint bending, and throwing motions."],

Techniques are available to mitigate flood damage and subsequent losses, but the ability to weigh such strategies with respect to their benefits from a community resilience perspective is limited in the literature. Investing in flood mitigation is critical for communities to protect the physical and socioeconomic systems that depend on them. While there are multiple mitigation options to implement at the building level, this paper focuses on determining the optimal flood mitigation strategy for buildings to minimize flood losses within a community. In this research, a mixed integer linear programming model is proposed for studying the effects and trade-offs associated with pre-event short-term and long-term mitigation strategies to minimize the expected economic losses associated with floods. The capabilities of the proposed model are illustrated for Lumberton, North Carolina (NC), a small, socially diverse inland community on the Lumber River. The mathematically optimal building-level flood mitigation plan is provided based on the available budget, which can significantly minimize the total expected direct economic loss of the community. The results reveal important correlations among investment quantity, building-level short- and long-term mitigation measures, flood depths of various locations, and buildings’ structure. Additionally, this study shows the trade-offs between short- and long-term mitigation measures based on available budget by providing decision support to building owners regarding mitigation measures for their buildings."],

Three case studies from Oklahoma’s Indigenous communities illustrate this transformation. Beginning in the mid-1960s, a boom in Indigenous media allowed Indigenous people to communicate far more quickly over once prohibitive distances. In western Oklahoma, Southern Cheyenne parents relied upon Navajo ideas to form their own indigenous controlled school in early 1973. As a result of these exchanges between previously removed people, new indigenous communities emerged along ideological lines rather than those of tribal citizenship or ethnic identity. A few months earlier, the National Indian Youth Council’s Oklahoma chapters, one such evolving ideological community out of many in the United States, successfully brought attention to and changed a key state policy affecting indigenous students in public schools. Even as Indigenous activists collaborated with new vigor, corresponding divisions emerged in existing Indigenous communities; Native people began to debate the meaning of the messages new communities popularized. The American Indian Movement attempted to hold its 1973 national convention at Pawnee, Oklahoma, only to find that Indigenous people in the region did not support the gathering as the movement’s leaders anticipated. Together, these three case studies present a portrait of a diverse, indigenous world that facilitated collaboration through Native media yet wrought with emerging ideological schisms."],

      abstract: ["Anthropogenic perturbations impact aquatic systems causing wide-ranging responses, from assemblage restructuring to assemblage recovery. Previous studies indicate the duration and intensity of disturbances play a role in the dynamics of assemblage recovery. In August 2011, the Pearl River, United States, was subjected to a weak black liquor spill from a paper mill which resulted in substantial loss of fish in a large stretch of the main channel. We quantified resilience and recovery of fish assemblage structure in the impacted area following the event. We compared downstream (impacted) assemblages to upstream (unimpacted) assemblages to determine initial impacts on structure. Additionally, we incorporated historic fish collections (1988–2011) to examine impacts on assemblage structure across broad temporal scales. Based on NMDS, upstream and downstream sites generally showed similar assemblage structure across sample periods with the exception of the 2 months postdischarge, where upstream and downstream sites visually differed. Multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) indicated significant seasonal variation among samples, but found no significant interaction between impacted and unimpacted assemblages following the discharge event. However, multivariate dispersion (MVDISP) showed greater variance among assemblage structure following the discharge event. These results suggest that 2 months following the disturbance represent a time period of stochasticity in regard to assemblage structure dynamics, and this was followed by rapid recovery. We term this dynamic the “hangover effect” as it represents the time frame from the cessation of the perturbation to the assemblage's return to predisturbance conditions. The availability and proximity of tributaries and upstream refugia, which were not affected by the disturbance, as well as the rapid recovery of abiotic parameters likely played a substantial role in assemblage recovery. This study not only demonstrates rapid recovery in an aquatic system, but further demonstrates the value of continuous, long-term, data collections which enhance our understanding of assemblage dynamics."],

Safety information includes road accidents, natural hazards, roadblocks, etc. Non-safety information includes tolling information, traveler information, etc. The main goal behind sharing this information is to enhance road safety and reduce road accidents by alerting the driver about the unexpected hazards. However, routing of messages in VANET is challenging due to packet delays arising from high mobility of vehicles, frequently changing topology and high density of vehicles, leading to frequent route breakages and packet losses.  This report summarizes the performance analysis of safety and non-safety message dissemination techniques in VANET based on the fog computing technique. Three main metrics to improve the performance of message dissemination are: 1) delay, 2) probability of message delivery, and 3) throughput. Analysis of such metrics plays an important role to improve the performance of existing message dissemination techniques. Simulations are usually conducted based on the metrics using ns-2 and Java discrete event simulator. The above three performance metrics and results published in literature help one to understand and increase the performance of various message dissemination techniques in a VANET environment."],

      abstract: ["We analyze, through molecular dynamics simulations, the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity (k) of chain-oriented amorphous polyethylene (PE). We ﬁnd that at increasing levels of orientation, the temperature corresponding to a peak k progressively decreases. Un-oriented PE exhibits the peak k at 350K, while aligned PE under an applied strain of 400% shows a maximum at 100K. This transition of peak k to lower temperatures with increasing alignment is explained in terms of a crossover from disorder to anharmonicity dominated phonon transport in aligned polymers. Evidence for this crossover is achieved by manipulating the disorder in the polymer structure and studying the resulting change in temperature corresponding to peak k. Disorder is modiﬁed through a change in the dihedral parameters of the potential function, allowing a change in the relative fraction of trans and gauche transformations. The results shed light on the underlying thermal transport processes in aligned polymers and hold importance for low temperature applications of polymer materials in thermal management technologies."],

      abstract: ["The American Lyceum Movement became a pivotal foundation of U.S. adult education during the nineteenth-century. Holbrook recognized adult learners’ educational demands diversified during the rise of industrialism. Thus, he ingeniously fashioned an adult learning complex outside restrictions commonly found in denominational higher education institutions. He did so in a fashion appealing to higher education standards of the time in both presentation and practicality. What began as an effort to create a network of community associations, designed for the promotion of applied sciences and mechanical arts, soon evolved into a massive national undertaking that encapsulated the emergent transcendental and reformist assertiveness of a young nation. The sheer expansiveness of the Lyceum Movement also set an influential groundwork that predisposed Justin Morrill to write the decisive legislation of the American Agricultural College Acts. Over the course of many years, Morrill was actively engaged in Lyceum activity. His direct interaction with the Lyceum helped him form rationalizations about the expanding demands of adult learners during the Industrial Revolution and the potential for westward expansion. This rationale eventually contributed to the formation of land-grant colleges. Morrill’s progressive institutions paralleled Holbrook’s undertaking and became part of the formal structure of U.S. higher education. As a result, access to higher education was expanded on an unprecedented scale. Examining this history sheds light on how advances in science and technology change the needs and demographics of adult learners fundamentally, historically, and in the modern day.",

It is important to model drug delivery to gain accurate predictions of how a drug will release into the body. These models help to maximize drug efficacy and safety. The drug release rate is primarily dependent on the rate at which the drug will diffuse out of its encapsulation. Several factors affect the drug release rate of a drug such as a temperature, pH, drug molecule size, surface area of the tablet, etc. To test some of these factors, in this experiment, alginate hydrophores of various sizes are loaded with being loaded with two different molecules. Each size of alginate hydrospheres will be loaded with either BSA or methylene blue. The factors affecting release rate are the surface area to volume ratio of the alginate hydrospheres, and the size of the molecule itself. As the small hydrospheres have a larger surface area to volume ratio they had a faster diffusion rate than the larger hydrospheres. In addition to this, BSA diffused slower than methylene blue as it had a larger molecular weight."],

Topics explored throughout its history include early inefficiencies, the introduction of hybrids that led to major improvements, and the increase in availability. The chapter then explores markets and commodities of electric vehicles, which explores the supply and demand side of this technology. We will show how growing demand has lead to improved government action, and how production methods must be improved for a sustainable future of electric vehicles. Finally, we test the ethics of electric vehicles, challenging the notion of nothing but the most ethical environmental standards. We will show how ways of metal mining and electricity generation actually do more bad than good for our environment.

From research, to development, to manufacturing, to user products, engineers are constantly needing to measure things: brightness of a light, dimensions of an object, separation between things, frequency content, stress, strain, pressure, voltage, etc. In the real world measuring systems are not perfect, so the results of a measurement are only an estimate of the true value. Instrumentation for making measurements relies on some fundamental assumptions to ensure the veracity of the measurements. Some key elements are: bandwidth, sampling rate, dynamic range, sensor type, etc. This text discusses the basic concepts of what a measurement is, how the instrumentation chosen (or developed) can affect the measurement, and how to deal with the measurement error that is in all instrumentation systems. Topics include data acquisition, signal conditioning, sensor types, and measurement noise and its various noise distributions. The text concludes with three user projects that bring together these topics into an informative work that reinforces the theory."],

From research, to development, to manufacturing, to user products, engineers are constantly needing to measure things: brightness of a light, dimensions of an object, separation between things, frequency content, stress, strain, pressure, voltage, etc. In the real world measuring systems are not perfect, so the results of a measurement are only an estimate of the true value. Instrumentation for making measurements relies on some fundamental assumptions to ensure the veracity of the measurements. Some key elements are: bandwidth, sampling rate, dynamic range, sensor type, etc. This text discusses the basic concepts of what a measurement is, how the instrumentation chosen (or developed) can affect the measurement, and how to deal with the measurement error that is in all instrumentation systems. Topics include data acquisition, signal conditioning, sensor types, and measurement noise and its various noise distributions. The text concludes with three user projects that bring together these topics into an informative work that reinforces the theory."],

      abstract: ["A supercell thunderstorm formed as part of a cluster of severe storms near Kingfisher, OK on 29 May 2012 during the Deep Convective Clouds & Chemistry (DC3) experiment. This storm produced 5” hail, an EF-1 tornado, and copious lightning over the course of a few hours. For part of the storm's lifetime, observations were obtained from mobile polarimetric radars and a balloon-borne electric field meter (EFM) and particle imager, while aircraft sampled the chemistry of the inflow and anvil. In addition, the storm was within the domain of the 3-dimensional Oklahoma Lightning Mapping Array (LMA), and the National Weather Service’s KTLX WSR-88D radar.",
        "This study focuses on a one-hour interval during which multi-Doppler coverage was available, and a balloon carrying an electric field meter (EFM), radiosonde, and particle imager flew through the storm. Data from KTLX are used to supplement mobile radar data. Flash rates, mapped very high frequency (VHF) source densities, and charge analyses are examined to give an overview of the storm’s electrical nature and evolution during that period. The charge inferred from lightning is compared to the charge inferred from EFM measurements to test how well the lightning-inferred charge analysis can be expanded to the whole storm.",
        "After an initial overview of the storm’s lifetime and the environment in which the storm formed, the evolution of the flash size distribution as it relates to the kinematics and microphysics of the storm is examined at three analysis times spanning the approximately 40 minute period during which triple-Doppler data were acquired. Flash rates increased rapidly during this time. Lightning flash density, the horizontal areas (i.e., footprints) of flashes, VHF source density, and the locations of flash initiations are then compared to storm microphysics and kinematics as observed by radar and retrieved by a diabatic Lagrangian analysis of the synthesized three- dimensional winds and reflectivity. The inferred charge structure of the storm and its evolution are also compared to these flash parameters and to the storm’s microphysics and kinematics. When the storm matured, flashes in an around the updraft were typically small. Flash sizes tended to increase as distance from the updraft increased; as the storm strengthened, the overall size of flashes in the storm decreased.",
        "Lightning flashes in the anvil, particularly those flashes that occurred several tens of kilometers from regions of deep convection, are also analyzed relative to radar reflectivity, ground strike points (provided by the National Lightning Detection Network), and inferred charge structure, to test hypotheses concerning how the flashes were initiated and why they propagated along certain paths. A region of convection strong enough to initiate lightning developed in the anvil during the analysis time and eventually propagated beyond the anvil. Its formation was consistent with being produced by evaporating virga falling from the anvil, as has been suggested previously."],

      abstract: ["The American Lyceum Movement became a pivotal foundation of U.S. adult education during the nineteenth-century. Holbrook recognized adult learners’ educational demands diversified during the rise of industrialism. Thus, he ingeniously fashioned an adult learning complex outside restrictions commonly found in denominational higher education institutions. He did so in a fashion appealing to higher education standards of the time in both presentation and practicality. What began as an effort to create a network of community associations, designed for the promotion of applied sciences and mechanical arts, soon evolved into a massive national undertaking that encapsulated the emergent transcendental and reformist assertiveness of a young nation. The sheer expansiveness of the Lyceum Movement also set an influential groundwork that predisposed Justin Morrill to write the decisive legislation of the American Agricultural College Acts. Over the course of many years, Morrill was actively engaged in Lyceum activity. His direct interaction with the Lyceum helped him form rationalizations about the expanding demands of adult learners during the Industrial Revolution and the potential for westward expansion. This rationale eventually contributed to the formation of land-grant colleges. Morrill’s progressive institutions paralleled Holbrook’s undertaking and became part of the formal structure of U.S. higher education. As a result, access to higher education was expanded on an unprecedented scale. Examining this history sheds light on how advances in science and technology change the needs and demographics of adult learners fundamentally, historically, and in the modern day.",

Neither specimen was recovered with associated teeth, making confident identification of the species impossible. However, both formations share a similar shark fauna, with Leptostyrax macrorhiza being the largest of the common lamniform sharks.

It will use the Year of Consecrated Life (YCL) as a case study to illuminate how American Catholics negotiate discourses of power, oppression, and agency within the Catholic tradition. The appeal of the YCL for the study is two-fold: (1) it is a year-long (November 2014 - February 2016) social, spiritual, and technological campaign undertaken by the Vatican that will reveal the latest Vatican media practices, and (2) the topic of religious life, which remains a Catholic practice perceived as quixotic and perpetuating gender norms. This poster presents a literature review and methodology to answer the following research question: How do Catholics respond to, engage with, and negotiate Vatican regulations of technology use? By attending to the textual discourse of the Roman Catholic Church, the study intends to address a gap in the literature regarding the exertion and use of authority by religious leaders through digital media, as well as the discursive mechanisms used by religious members through digital media to subvert and challenge their leaders’ authority."],

      abstract: ["Anthropogenic perturbations impact aquatic systems causing wide-ranging responses, from assemblage restructuring to assemblage recovery. Previous studies indicate the duration and intensity of disturbances play a role in the dynamics of assemblage recovery. In August 2011, the Pearl River, United States, was subjected to a weak black liquor spill from a paper mill which resulted in substantial loss of fish in a large stretch of the main channel. We quantified resilience and recovery of fish assemblage structure in the impacted area following the event. We compared downstream (impacted) assemblages to upstream (unimpacted) assemblages to determine initial impacts on structure. Additionally, we incorporated historic fish collections (1988–2011) to examine impacts on assemblage structure across broad temporal scales. Based on NMDS, upstream and downstream sites generally showed similar assemblage structure across sample periods with the exception of the 2 months postdischarge, where upstream and downstream sites visually differed. Multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) indicated significant seasonal variation among samples, but found no significant interaction between impacted and unimpacted assemblages following the discharge event. However, multivariate dispersion (MVDISP) showed greater variance among assemblage structure following the discharge event. These results suggest that 2 months following the disturbance represent a time period of stochasticity in regard to assemblage structure dynamics, and this was followed by rapid recovery. We term this dynamic the “hangover effect” as it represents the time frame from the cessation of the perturbation to the assemblage's return to predisturbance conditions. The availability and proximity of tributaries and upstream refugia, which were not affected by the disturbance, as well as the rapid recovery of abiotic parameters likely played a substantial role in assemblage recovery. This study not only demonstrates rapid recovery in an aquatic system, but further demonstrates the value of continuous, long-term, data collections which enhance our understanding of assemblage dynamics."],

      abstract: ["Who were the First Americans? Where did they come from? When did they get here? Are they the ancestors of modern Native Americans? These questions might seem straightforward, but scientists in competing fields have failed to convince one another with their theories and evidence, much less Native American peoples. The practice of science in its search for the First Americans is a flawed endeavor, Robert V. Davis tells us. His book is an effort to explain why.",
        "Most American history textbooks today teach that the First Americans migrated to North America on foot from East Asia over a land bridge during the last ice age, 12,000 to 13,000 years ago. In fact, that theory hardly represents the scientific consensus, and it has never won many Native adherents. In many ways, attempts to identify the first Americans embody the conflicts in American society between accepting the practical usefulness of science and honoring cultural values. Davis explores how the contested definition of “First Americans” reflects the unsettled status of Native traditional knowledge, scientific theories, research methodologies, and public policy as they vie with one another for legitimacy in modern America. In this light he considers the traditional beliefs of Native Americans about their origins; the struggle for primacy—or even recognition as science—between the disciplines of anthropology and archaeology; and the mediating, interacting, and sometimes opposing influences of external authorities such as government agencies, universities, museums, and the press.",
        "Fossil remains from Mesa Verde, Clovis, and other sites testify to the presence of First Americans. What remains unsettled, as The Search for the First Americans makes clear, is not only who these people were, where they came from, and when, but also the very nature and practice of the science searching for answers.",

In the following weeks and months, they would be joined by some 10,000 of the more than 120,000 people of Japanese descent, two-thirds of them U.S. citizens, incarcerated as “domestic enemy aliens” during World War II. Heart Mountain became a town with workplaces, social groups, and political alliances—in short, networks. These networks are the focus of Saara Kekki’s Japanese Americans at Heart Mountain.",
        "Interconnections between people are the foundation of human societies. Exploring the creation of networks at Heart Mountain, as well as movement to and from the camp between 1942 and 1945, this book offers an unusually detailed look at the formation of a society within the incarcerated community, specifically the manifestation of power, agency, and resistance. Kekki constructs a dynamic network model of all of Heart Mountain’s residents and their interconnections—family, political, employment, social, and geospatial networks—using historical “big data” drawn from the War Relocation Authority and narrative sources, including the camp newspaper Heart Mountain Sentinel. For all the inmates, life inevitably went on: people married, had children, worked, and engaged in politics. Because of the duration of the incarceration, many became institutionalized and unwilling to leave the camps when the time came. Yet most individuals, Kekki finds, took charge of their own destinies despite the injustice and looked forward to the day when Heart Mountain was behind them.",
        "Especially timely in its implications for debates over immigration and assimilation, Japanese Americans at Heart Mountain presents a remarkable opportunity to reconstruct a community created under duress within the larger American society, and to gain new insight into an American experience largely lost to official history.",

Then, Virginia officials asserted that no Virginia Indians could be other than legally Black, given centuries of love and marriage across color lines. How indigenous peoples of Virginia resisted erasure and built their identities as Native Americans is the powerful story this book tells. Spanning a century of fraught history, Being Indigenous in Jim Crow Virginia describes the critical strategic work that tidewater Virginia Indians, descendants of the seventeenth-century Algonquian Powhatan chiefdom, undertook to sustain their Native identity in the face of deep racial hostility from segregationist officials, politicians, and institutions.",
        "Like other Southeastern Native groups living under Jim Crow regimes, tidewater Native groups and individuals fortified their communities by founding tribal organizations, churches, and schools; they displayed their Indianness in public performances; and they enlisted whites, including well-known ethnographers, to help them argue for their Native distinctness. Describing an arduous campaign marked by ingenuity, conviction, and perseverance, Laura J. Feller shows how these tidewater Native people drew on their shared histories as descendants of Powhatan peoples, and how they strengthened their bonds through living and marrying within clusters of Native Virginians, both on and off reservation lands. She also finds that, by at times excluding African Americans from Indian organizations and Native families, Virginian Indians themselves reinforced racial segregation while they built their own communities.",

O’Neill presented these self-contained artificial worlds as affordable solutions to the swelling economic, environmental, and industrial problems that threatened late twentieth century life. Proponents of space colonies commissioned concept art to translate their technical designs into accessible, attainable, and, most importantly, appealing places in their audiences’ imaginations. To paint attractive pictures of life aboard space colonies, however, artists first had to decide what made contemporary life on Earth desirable to their audiences. Pieces of space colony concept art produced in the mid-1970s thus advertise a specific vision of life in space, one unequivocally shaped by popular anxieties and fantasies about postmodern American life. By interpreting these artworks as advertisements, I aim to understand how artists and scientists alike employed concept art as a place-making tool to code space colonies as both bountiful natural oases and novel [American] cities – places ultimately designed for and inhabited by a new class of citizens."],

      abstract: ["Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) allows vehicles to send information to each other or to roadside equipment in an instant and a wireless manner. It represents a considerable step forward in terms of transportation. Indeed, many applications could benefit from instantly transmitting data such as video and music streaming. Internet connectivity could also be available to the passengers. The main objective and improvement aimed by VANET is a security matter. Warning messages for weather conditions, traffic accidents and fuel consumption instantly transmitted between vehicles would improve road safety. However, one of the critical issues in VANET is the dissemination of messages throughout the network. Indeed, routing algorithms are a key issue because of the high mobility and scalability of VANET compared to other ad-hoc networks. \r\nThis thesis contributes to the research area by firstly presenting a survey over most of the routing protocol used in VANET and classifying them according to the algorithm used. Secondly, this thesis develops more on the broadcasting algorithm category and particularly on the distance to mean heuristic method that presents good results in terms of reachability and bandwidth consumption. However, distance to mean protocol needs periodic beacons that creates a consequent overhead compared to instant rebroadcasting algorithm. Therefore, this thesis improves this method by reducing overhead using a bio inspired kinetic graph model proposed in the literature.  The proposed modified algorithm has been implemented, simulated and evaluated in the network simulator NS3. Results show a lower overhead while preserving a good reachability."],

My primary purpose in this work is to show that while James has no systematic \"theory of community,\" he does have important things to say about our \"experience of community.\" In showing this, I also indirectly respond to the claim made against James' social philosophy.\r\nI call attention to the importance of James' theory of relations--where both conjunctive and disjunctive relations are held to be as real as  the terms they connect--to his position as regards both the self, and the relation of selves known as the community. This is also the basis for James' suggestion that on the common sense level of daily life, we operate within the framework of a narrative concept of selfhood.\r\nOur experience of community consists of three overlapping areas; the materials, social, and spiritual. In the first area, our focus is upon \"me and mine.\" In the second, it is on our social relations. The third has to do with the moral relations that exist between ourselves and other members. I suggest that a hypothetical Jamesean community is one that is pragmatic in orientation. James characterizes the pragmatic community as \"an experiment of the most searching kind.\""],

      abstract: ["Recently, the development of hydrophobic nanoporous technologies has drawn increased attention, especially for the applications of energy absorption and impact protection. Although significant amount of research has been conducted to synthesis and characterize materials to protect structures from impact damage, the tradition methods focused on converting kinetic energy to other forms, such as heat and cell buckling. Due to their high energy absorption efficiency, hydrophobic nanoporous particle liquids (NPLs) are one of the most attractive impact mitigation materials. During impact, such particles directly trap liquid molecules inside the non-wetting surface of nanopores in the particles. The captured impact energy is simply stored temporarily and isolated from the original energy transmission path. In this paper we will investigate the energy absorption efficiency of combinations of silica nanoporous particles and with multiple liquids. Inorganic particles, such as nanoporous silica, are characterized using scanning electron microscopy. Small molecule promoters, such as methanol and ethanol, are introduced to the prepared NPLs. Their effects on the energy absorption efficiency are studied in this paper. NPLs are prepared by dispersing the studied materials in deionized water. Energy absorption efficiency of these liquids are experimentally characterized using an Instron mechanical testing frame and in-house develop stainless steel hydraulic cylinder system."],

      abstract: ["This thesis investigated active publics’ communicative course of action by evaluating variables such as individual ethical orientation and perceived opinion climate, providing insight on the justification of the communicative behavior. The Situational Theory of Problem Solving (STOPS) and the Communicative Action for Problem Solving model (CAPS) inquire about the most probable communicative action taken by the different ethical orientations – deontological and teleological. The study accounted for two types of public opinion perception bias –Hostile Media Perception and Projection Bias.\r\nBesides public opinion, the study analyzed how different active publics communicate and interact and how ethical orientation comes into play. The results show that views expressed by or projected on the media influence more communicative action, while the opinion projected unto peers in one’s circle tends to influence cross-interaction avoidance. The results suggest that, while there is a safer environment for information forwarding, under the same conditions, when communicative action increases, so does cross-interaction avoidance. Therefore, social conversations become more of a “give and give” dynamic instead of a dialogical “give and take” of information. \r\nEthical orientation shows significant influence on communicative action. The difference between deontologists’ and teleologists’ pathways to communicative action is a phenomenon practitioners need to observe when analyzing immediate or delayed actions of their target public.\r\nKeywords: situational theory, ethical orientation, deontology, communicative behavior, publics, Black Lives Matter, cross-interaction avoidance"],

      abstract: ["Passive treatment of mine drainage provides demonstrated water quality improvements and substantial removal of ecotoxic metals via biogeochemical, microbiological, and physical mechanisms. When mine drainage is treated to a quality that satisfies the pertinent ambient water quality criteria, it is often discharged into a receiving water body. If sufficiently treated mine water could be safely reused in agricultural applications – crop irrigation or livestock watering –available surface and groundwater reserves could be freed up for other beneficial uses. Three common Oklahoma crops – field corn (Zea mays var. indentata), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), and Bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon) – were irrigated in potting mix from seed with either groundwater from Canadian River alluvium or treated lead-zinc mine water from the effluent of the Mayer Ranch Passive Treatment System (Tar Creek Superfund Site, Commerce, OK). Crop growth and chemical composition were monitored through regular measurements of above-ground height and growth stage as well as final determinations of biomass production and trace metals concentrations. Mine water irrigation did not have a significant effect on seedling emergence, plant growth, or biomass production for corn or Bermuda grass, whereas sorghum exhibited a temporary reduction in growth and a decrease in biomass production under mine water irrigation. The crops were exposed to metals in irrigation waters, fertilizer, and commercial potting mix; irrigation was the smallest contributor of many of the metal species. Cd, Na, and S accumulated in mine water-irrigated substrate. Mine water irrigation did not significantly increase concentrations of Fe, Mn, Zn, K, Ni, or Pb in any of the three species, had mixed effects on Ca concentrations, and increased concentrations of Cd in roots and Mg in belowground and aboveground biomass of some structures. Na and S concentrations in some corn and sorghum root structures and in all Bermuda grass biomass were elevated by mine water irrigation. Hard-rock, net-alkaline mine drainage can be treated in ecologically-engineered systems and reused for the irrigation of some plant species without detriment to emergence patterns, growth, or biomass production. Conversely, passively-treated mine water reuse for livestock watering would be limited by high sulfate levels and transportation costs."],

      abstract: ["For the first time, this thesis presents a new approach to characterize reservoir layering and cross flow between layers using Inter-Well Chemical Tracer Test (ICTT). ICTT is a well-known reliable test for reservoir characterization. During ICTT, a slug of chemical components is injected into subsurface and monitored at producers. Analysis of tracer production history (i.e. tracer produced concentration versus time) provides the reservoir properties. Since reservoirs are usually layered with significant heterogeneity, it is crucial to understand and interpret tracer movement in a stratified system. This study is divided into three parts:\r\nPart1- A comprehensive literature review on inter-well tracer test applications in oil reservoirs is presented. The review includes analytical/numerical methods used to evaluate the results. Limitations and advantages of various evaluation methods are reviewed in detail. \r\nPart2- A new formulation is presented to study tracer propagation along streamlines in heterogeneous reservoirs. The streamlines in this study are modeled as analogous reservoir layers with no cross flow. The fraction of layers where tracer transport occurs faster than the solution of convection–diffusion equation(CDE) is determined; this fraction represents layers through which channeling may take place; obviously, the larger the fraction, the lower the sweep efficiency. Moreover, Ranger field is used to demonstrate how to decouple the convoluted effects of the channeling from small-scale heterogeneity.\r\nPart3- A new formulation is developed to model the crossflow between layers through calculating the dynamic fraction of injected fluid permeating into each layer as a function of time. Previous models fail to detect crossflow between layers. Several numerical simulation and the same field examples are employed to verify the proposed method. A ‘bridge’ is artificially created in numerical simulation to mimic the major crossflow. The simulation results indicate that tracer can be used to detect and evaluate crossflow. The distance between injector and crossflow can significantly change the tracer production history. The field example was based on the ICTT conducted in Ranger Field. We successfully match the field tracer data and our result indicates the existence of crossflow. Identification of crossflow between layers is critical step to understand reservoir complexity and could provide helpful insight for successful enhance oil recovery (EOR) projects. The proposed method can be easily performed in spreadsheet with the limited data."],

      abstract: ["Ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) is being utilized in bridge construction primarily for deck overlays and end-of-girder and beam repairs of deteriorated traditional concrete elements. UHPC has been used selectively in new construction to form full-sized structural members. Compared to conventional concrete, UHPC has the benefits of having higher compressive strength, being more ductile, and being self-consolidating. Because of these qualities, it can be used in very thin beams with shallower depths than a conventional concrete member could. Before it can be used on a larger scale more must be known about the failures that can occur. The current ACI Code (ACI 318-19 2019) places an upper limit on the compressive strength allowed in the shear capacity equation of 10,000 psi. UHPC can have strengths more than double this and may not behave as expected. The aim of this project was to quantify the shear capacity of UHPC beams. The testing regimen for this project included two conventional concrete beams and three UHPC beams. The mix for the conventional concrete was based on an Oklahoma Department of Transportation Class AA, having a compressive strength of approximately 9,000 psi. The UHPC followed the non-proprietary mix design develop at the University of Oklahoma, designated J3, which had a compressive strength of 17,000 psi.\r\n\r\nThe beam specimens tested were approximately a half-scale AASHTO Type B beam with some exaggerated proportions to better facilitate shear failure. All beams were of the same dimensions, having an overall depth of 16 in., an effective depth of 14.25 in., a web height of 8 in., and a web thickness of 2 in. A total beam length of 14 ft was chosen to allow for a 12-ft testing region under third-point loading. There were supports under the beam at 1 ft from each end and loading was applied 5 ft from each end, giving equivalent 4-ft uniform shearing \r\nregions. All beams were fitted with a reinforcing cage having no shear reinforcement in the zones under shear. Longitudinal reinforcement included three #6 reinforcing bars. Each member was tested at 28 days to allow for full-strength development. The UHPC beams did not fail in shear. With approximately 4 in. of deflection, the beams exhibited significant flexural cracking and minor shear cracks. The maximum load for each UHPC specimen exceeded an equivalent shear capacity of over 9√𝑓′𝑐𝑏𝑤𝑑. From this research, it was concluded that the current ACI Code (2019) design guidance is insufficiently accurate and overly conservative for UHPC members, but more research is required."],

We employ polarization-shift keying (POLSK) to generate an expected pattern of changing states of polarization (SOPs). We generate a random sequence of voltages that represents a random sequence of bits, then we encode this sequence in the state of polarization. we apply the sequence of voltages -using the DAQ assistant- to the polarization modulator to embed this random sequence of bits in the state of polarization. At the far end, we collect the Stokes parameters data of the encoded file using polarization detector. Then, we reduce the dimensions of the collected data to one dimension using a Matlab code. In the final stage of the data recovery, we process the data and discriminate bits using both averaging and machine learning techniques to recover the random sequence that has been sent. Finally, by comparing the sent data set with the recovered data set. We can calculate the efficiency of data recovery process or the bit error rate of the received file. These POLSK symbols will be encoded in a fully polarized light. We will encode binary POLSK, 4-POLSK and 8-POLSK symbols in the SOPs of light in different runs. Also, we will propose the use of averaging to process the Stokes parameters that result from encoding binary POLSK and machine learning techniques to analyze the process of the Stokes parameters that belong to 4-POLSK and 8-POLSK. The state of polarization is presented by five variables. Three of them are the Stokes parameters S1, S2, and S3. The other two are the angles 2γ, 2β. The final dimension is going to be the horizontal angle in the Poincare Sphere representation. Then, we are going to predict the class (symbol) that belongs to each part of processed data. The length of the data points that represent each symbol is dominated by the sampling rate at the receiver. Symbol prediction will be accomplished using the classification learner’s techniques called K-Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Machine. Basically, these techniques predict the class of the data based on the model built using guided data (row data and its class). Finally, we match the predicted class with the original symbol file to measure the accuracy of the prediction models. In other words, the number of symbols that has been predicted successfully."],

Using percolation theory, effective medium theory and critical path analysis along with bimodal fractal regime, we estimate relative permeability curves for 100 samples of Bakken, Eagle Ford, Woodford, and Wolfcamp formations. The process also allows estimation of percolation and fractal parameters like coordination number and fractal dimension which facilitate description of the pore network for these shale samples.

We study the sensitivities of pressure transients to fracture characteristics, such as fracture length, fracture compressibility, fracture permeability, angle of orientation, and fracture volume fraction in the reservoir. In doing so, we identify diagnostic signatures associated with these fracture characteristics."],

Unfortunately, recent research has demonstrated a variety of acute negative outcomes\r\nassociated with exposure to disturbing news content, such as increased negative affect, anxiety,\r\nand stress.

To address this gap, 30\r\nveteran police officers completed a cognitive assessment battery both prior to and following\r\nexposure to either negatively-valenced or positively-valenced media clips in order to examine the\r\neffect of media exposure on officers’ performance on basic cognitive tasks.

Despite lack\r\nof acute cognitive decrements, officers did indicate that negative publicity surrounding officer\r\nactivity makes it more difficult and dangerous to work in law enforcement.

The change in phase behavior and phase equilibrium are key to understand the reservoir condition and estimate production from a particular formation. In shale reservoirs, hydrocarbon phase behavior in nanopores can be affected by various factors such as pore proximity and pore size distribution. In many shale and tight oil and gas reservoirs, pore sizes are in the ranges of nanometers. \r\nVarious simulation models are seen in literature attempting to predict phase behavior under confinement but there is no good reference of experimental results for verification. Our research team is trying to conduct phase behavior tests for single, binary, and multi-component hydrocarbon mixtures under confinement to validate and test the various simulation models. Since that’s not an easy endeavor, each of us in the research team has taken on one of the challenging tasks to accomplish the goal. My particular goal is to examine the feasibility of a new experimental procedure for detecting the edge of the phase envelope.\r\nThe new experimental approach for detecting the phase envelope was examined through numerical simulation of binary hydrocarbon mixtures in bulk since these bulk simulation numbers have been verified experimentally in the past.  The binary hydrocarbon mixtures we examined were Ethane with Propane, Pentane, Heptane and Hexane with 50-50 mole percentage. As per the experimental feasibility in the laboratory and lower temperature and pressure ranges available, various compositions of Ethane-Pentane system were studied in order to design the experimental parameters. The results of this study will be used by the rest of the members in the research team to conduct the experiments as it provided them with the most suitable system to explore in the laboratory."],

      abstract: ["The Wolfcamp Series in the Southern Delaware Basin of West Texas is Permian in age and is composed of a mix of siliciclastics and carbonates deposited through pelagic sedimentation, turbidity currents, and mass wasting in a deep-water environment. A more isolated depositional system was present in the study area than in the rest of the Southern Delaware basin during Wolfcamp time. The Central Basin Platform to the East, and the Waha and Coyanosa structural features to the West and South form a mini basin in northern Pecos County. Isolation resulted in lithologies with less siliciclastic input compared to other areas in the Southern Delaware Basin. One objective of the study is to determine the depositional setting for the Wolfcamp Formation in this sub basin in order to characterize the reservoir and specifically test if a turbidite fan model is applicable to the Wolfcamp Formation in this study area.  A second objective is to characterize the diagenesis and test if there is evidence for alteration by late fluids. \r\nUsing a core from the Southern Delaware Basin, the reservoir characteristics of the upper Wolfcamp are being analyzed. Eight different lithofacies were observed in the core. Two of the more siliceous lithofacies have the best reservoir characteristics. Based on observed depositional features, stacking patterns, chemostratigraphic proxies, log character, and thin section observations, it is hypothesized that a channelized submarine fan system was active off the Central Basin Platform during Upper Wolfcamp deposition in the study area. An overall coarsening upward package is interpreted as the system was prograding out into the basin. Levee deposits, lobes, and channel fill deposits are present in the cored interval.\r\nDiagenesis is complex, with multiple stages and multiple paragenetic sequences observed throughout the core. Different lithologies have experienced varying degrees of diagenesis. The carbonate clasts inherited diagenetic features from the source area and record events during late diagenesis in the basin. Mudstones features that are both internally and externally sourced phases. Early diagenesis contains phases that are primarily self-sourced. Middle and late diagenesis contains mineralized fractures and other diagenetic phases acquired from external fluids migrating through the system."],

Through the perspectives of cognitive and perceptual forms of epistemology, written forms of language can and do influence reception to non-verbal utterance in a socially significant manner. Ideologies of language predispose linguistic and anthropological research against considerations of written linguistic artifacts and their roles in constituting ascribed social meaning. Signed forms of utterance are constrained by standardization and grammaticality, which in turn iconize and erase written language variation. When written variation is intentionally produced, it creates perceptually derived, ideologically charged responses that affect social attitudes and discourses. I address the methods and foci of sociolinguistic research for their pertinence to non-spoken language. I then analyze variation in written language in the domains of audiovisual animated media and African American dialect literature to show how socially significant responses to written variation create stratification by constructing fictive speech classes which are indexed to real speech communities. This investigation aims to clarify how modes of language transmission share properties assumed to be domain-specific, as well as to warrant a reexamination of the phonocentric concept of language in linguistic anthropology. As written forms of language are central to digital media, traditional sociolinguistic research must account for the written word just as it does the spoken."],

      abstract: ["In 1974, the Indian Health Service (IHS) hospital in Claremore, Oklahoma sterilized forty-eight Native American women in the month of July alone. Most of these women were in their twenties. This is a staggering number compared to the amount of Native American women serviced in the surrounding community. At the time, it was also reported that Native American patients were being actively “turned away by the hospital on the grounds that there were not sufficient funds to care for them.” This local event foregrounds the scholarly work done throughout this thesis. The main argument of this paper is that Native nurses were the real leaders of the activist movement against sterilization abuses. This thesis concludes by examining the solidarity between different women’s activist groups of the 1970s. These women activists understood themselves as united through experiences of violence and their fight as a shared effort to overthrow imperialism and colonialism."],

These states suffered great loss from prolonged drought conditions, with D4 (exceptional drought) conditions affecting almost the entire state of Texas and nearly seventy percent of Oklahoma. When the long-term drought conditions finally ended in the spring of 2015 as El Niño brought record amounts of precipitation to the region, there were also catastrophic floods that caused loss of life and property. Hydrologic extremes, such as these, have occurred throughout the historical record; however, decision makers need to know how the frequency of these events is expected to vary in a changing climate so that they can mitigate for these impacts and losses. Therefore, the goals of this study focus on how these hydrologic extremes impact water resources in the Red River Basin, how the frequency of such events is expected to change in the future, and how this study can aid local water resource managers and decision makers. To accomplish these goals, this study uses statistically downscaled climate projections of daily minimum and maximum temperature and daily precipitation. These projections were used to first detect the mean daily changes in temperature and precipitation through the end of the century, and then to identify the future trends in heavy precipitation events at the historical 90th and 99th percentiles and severe drought events at a threshold of the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index’s value of less than or equal to -1.5."],

Experimental and numerical studies were performed for each separation method and results and discussions were provided. The experimental study of the cyclone separator using various water-based slurries showed that pure water could be recovered from the slurry when the solid particles had a sufficiently greater density than the water. For solid particles lighter than water, however, pure water could not be recovered and both outlet streams contained different amounts of solid particles. The numerical results from the hydraulic wash column model predicted an optimum inlet flow velocity for the column and the experiments were performed successfully for a batchwise separation process. Recommendations were made for enabling continuous separation process using the wash column."],

To close this research gap, this thesis walks through a demonstration of the importance of including uncertainty in the decision analysis to later propose a novel methodology that employs simulation data that encapsulates both uncertainty and complexity of failures modeled by domain experts. Thus, this work is divided in two parts.\r\n\r\nThe first part of this work examines how component importance measures fail to give the necessary intuition for mitigation planning in the light of uncertainty. The analysis is assisted by a novel component importance measure called probabilistic delta centrality that demonstrates how previously neglected stochastic considerations change decisions suggested. \r\n\r\nIn the second part, a new paradigm for stochastic network mitigation is proposed. The approach leverages realizations from scenario event simulations to develop a probabilistic framework that supports constrained decision making. This scenario event simulation framework is capable of comprising component fragilities, correlation among random variables, and other physical aspects that affect component failure probabilities. On the top of that, a statistical learning model is built to enable a rapid estimation of post-disruption impact, which permits a metaheuristic to intelligently explore feasible discrete enhancements from mitigation strategies. The search for near-optimal solutions can be restricted by limited resources and potential political, social, and safety limitations. Two examples are presented to exhibit how this method provides detailed information for mitigation. The level of complexity embedded in search along with its detailed solutions are pioneering in network mitigation planning."],

      abstract: ["Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death and a leading cause of disability in the state of Oklahoma and the United States. Although there are several approaches to stroke rehabilitation, most stroke survivors live with upper limb impairments, which causes difficulties for independent living and social participation. One promising method for rehabilitation of the upper limb following stroke is focal muscle vibration, thought to work by activating the Ia afferent muscle spindle fibers for somatosensory and motor cortex stimulation. In this thesis, I describe the development of a novel wearable focal vibration device, called FoVi. Then, I report the findings from a pilot study of the feasibility and efficacy of the FoVi device in a short-term intervention. The FoVi device was developed according to design criteria specified through a focus group, including being comfortable and easy to use, having vibration motor pods controlled by an app on the user’s smartphone, and recording usage logs for real-time communication with therapists. Short-term interventions with FoVi show promise in increasing upper limb mobility and function, evidenced through non-significant increases in Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity score, Chedoke Arm- Hand Activity Inventory score, and grip strength. In conclusion, the FoVi device could be a helpful treatment method in stroke rehabilitation, and future long-term intervention studies with larger sample sizes and more robust outcome measures may show significant improvements in upper limb function. Combination with other treatment modalities, such as transcranial direct current stimulation, may enable a more effective treatment of the upper limb in stroke patients."],

Among of which, New Radio (NR)-based access to unlicensed spectrum, commonly known as 5G NR-U. Current technical reports have identified Listen-Before-Talk (LBT) as a working assumption in the process of standardizing NR-U channel access scheme. LBT was originally developed for Licensed-Assisted Access (LAA) in release 13 of the 3GPP specifications, which was based on ETSI regulations. This research examines how next-generation wireless systems using LBT perform under vastly presumed 5G NR dense deployments, and how the coexistence landscape manifests in the homogeneous prospect rather than the widely investigated heterogeneous counterpart, e.g. with Wi-Fi.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: In this work, a simulator was developed in C++ to help analyze different intra-network NR-U co-channel scenarios under saturated traffic. The simulator was validated with Markov Chain analytical model to confirm the procedures and algorithms conform to the standard delineated by the 3GPP specifications.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Simulation results indicated inefficiency in channel utilization of homogeneous dense deployments with high priority traffic classes. For instance, the effective channel utilization drops to less than 10% when only 20 devices share the channel with traffic tagged as priority 4, e.g., voice calls. Moreover, mean delay between successful packet transmissions in aforesaid scenario turned out to be around 1 second and exponentially increasing with the number of devices sharing the channel. We demonstrated through simulations how LBT devices can be unfair when sharing the channel with others exhibiting different traffic priority classes. A video streaming device – i.e. class 3 – for example, takes away 42% of the channel when sharing it with other 7 devices browsing the internet – i.e. class 2 – leaving them with 34% of useful channel time to split. The remaining 24% of the time packets collide with each other, rendering the channel futile and reducing the overall throughput.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: Literature is inundated with research on cross-technology coexistence analysis. This work aims to study same-technology wireless coexistence performance and underlines the importance of improving channel access mechanisms in next-generation wireless communication."],

In response, the OU-TU School of Community Medicine, the Anne and Henry Zarrow School of Social Work, and the Simulation Center at OU-Tulsa partnered with faculty from the OSU College of Osteopathic Medicine to design and implement a three-part education and training module promoting queer-affirmative practice among medical school and social work students.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: This introductory module begins with a lecture-based overview of human sexuality that emphasizes caring for the specific healthcare and social needs of SGM populations. The initial lecture is followed by a high-fidelity simulation with standardized patient actors (SPs) to implement the practices discussed. To better provide an authentic simulation experience, special attention is taken to recruit SPs who identify as members of the LGBTQIA+ community. The simulation cases begin with a patient presenting a complaint of anxiety related to SGM status, requiring students to work collaboratively to adequately address those needs. Skills emphasized throughout the simulation include interprofessional communication, queer-affirmative practice, expressing empathy and building rapport with patients. Finally, all students engage in a debriefing process—first as pairs with their respective SPs, then as a collective group with all SPs and training facilitators. All participants (N = 24) completed a standardized pre-post educational assessment, evaluating the development of clinical skills related to SGM populations, the importance of this material to their profession, their comfort working with SGM populations, their confidence in working with SGM populations, and the importance of affirmative practice to their profession.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: A repeated measures ANOVA analyzed changes over time, both within groups (i.e., all students) and between groups (i.e., medical/social work students). Results indicated statistically significant improvements within groups on all measures (p < .05) except attitudes (a subscale of the LGBTDOCSS) (p = .382) with all significant results having large effect sizes (η2p > .2). Additionally, results indicated no statistically significant difference between groups (p > .05). In sum, the results validate the affirmative-practice module as an effective teaching method for students, regardless of discipline.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: The results of this study illustrate the capabilities of interdisciplinary education in the form of didactics and high-fidelity simulation to educate students on how to address the complex issues faced by SGM populations."],

While research has linked neighborhood crime to asthma, multivariate causal modeling has not been used to test toxic stress as the mechanism that links the two. The current study investigates neighborhood crime as a driver of pediatric asthma diagnoses via toxic stress.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: A retrospective geospatial analysis of health and crime data was conducted. Health data was collected from the OU-Tulsa General Pediatric Clinic’s Electronic Medical Record while crime data was collected from the Tulsa Police Department. All variables were mapped geospatially using census tract as the unit of analysis. Structural equation modeling was used to test the causal model. Neighborhood crime indicators included homicide, rape, and narcotic-related offenses. Diagnoses of conduct, attention deficit, and other anxiety disorders were used in the analysis as toxic stress indicators. Asthma diagnoses were the outcome variable. To further test the model, data from 2016 was used as a calibration sample while data from 2017 was used as a validation sample.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: A full mediation model of high crime neighborhoods (n = 134) as a driver of toxic stress resulting in increased asthma diagnoses fit the 2016 data well (Χ2 = 15.6, p =.27; df = 13; RMSEA = .04 [90% CI: .00, .10]; CFI: .99; SRMR = .04). The results indicated the model accounted for 78% (R2 = .78) of the variance in asthma diagnoses. The model also provided a good fit to the 2017 data (X2= 23.6, p<.001; df= 13; RMSEA = .08 [90% CI: .02, .13]; CFI: .96; SRMR=.06).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: The results of the current study have important practice and research implications. While clinicians and researchers have become increasingly aware of the impact of social determinants of health, there has been little focus on improving clinical practices. Physicians interested in alleviated the burden of toxic stress and asthma should explore ways to reduce neighborhood crime at the policy level while also being aware of each of their patients’ unique circumstances in relation to where they live."],

      abstract: ["BACKGROUND: Many early childhood programs offer various professional development opportunities in different formats for teachers (Guskey, 2003). However, the effectiveness of professional development trainings on teacher practices is often questioned (Son, Kwon, Jeon, & Hong, 2013). This could be due to trainings not being tailored to individual teachers’ characteristics, needs, and preferences. There have been few studies that examined teacher experiences with professional development trainings, their views on future training opportunities (Buell et al., 2000; Dunst & Raab, 2010) and an assessment of the teachers’ unique professional development needs. Thus, this phenomenological study examined early childhood teachers’ experiences with and needs for professional development trainings and how their views differ by their characteristics (i.e., age group they serve, level of education, teaching certification).\r\n\r\nMETHODS: Forty teachers from 14 early childhood settings were interviewed for an hour and completed a survey created for the Early Childhood Educator Workforce study. They came from diverse racial (17.1% African American, 43.9% Caucasian, 12.2% Hispanic, 17.1% Native American, 9.8% Biracial) and educational backgrounds (39.1% hold bachelor's degrees or higher). Participants had a range of teaching experiences with a mean of 11 years (SD = 9.27, range of 0.7 to 41.0). Participants were purposefully selected to participate by teaching in an infant/toddler or preschool classroom in a southwestern state. InVivo coding was used for data analysis as way to gain a better understanding of the participants’ perceptions on professional development.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Preliminary analysis using InVivo revealed 100% of participants found conferences, workshops, and coaching style trainings effective for learning. Desired content for future trainings varied by teachers’ characteristics. For example, needs for learning more about effective instructional and individualized learning strategies, including differentiating between student levels, individualized learning plans, and new activities for children, were prevalent among teachers with higher educational levels and infant and toddler teachers. How to handle challenging and difficult behaviors were the content focus for future trainings from non-bachelor's degree holding educators and non-certified teachers. Conscious discipline was identified as a desirable topic for preschool teachers.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: Regardless of individual characteristics, all teachers believed more curriculum related training was needed and preferred an interactive hands-on approach to learning. From these results, we suggest professional trainings may be more effective in engaging early childhood teachers if they accommodate the situation, needs, and characteristics of teachers."],

      abstract: ["BACKGROUND: The Early Lifestyle Intervention (ELI) Clinic is an OU Physicians Pediatrics specialty clinic dedicated to helping children achieve healthier weights via behavioral modification through a multidisciplinary team approach. Children between 2–18 years of age from North Eastern Oklahoma are eligible for ELI referral if their BMI is at the 95th percentile or above. It is estimated that 30–40% of patients never make their ELI appointments after referral. This study explored predictive factors of patient follow-up to these appointments.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: A retrospective chart review of 121 pediatric patients with ELI referrals made between January 2010 and March 2018 was conducted. Patients were grouped into three categories based on follow-up status for this intervention: immediate (attended first ELI appointment made at time of referral), late (did not attend first ELI appointment but eventually saw ELI provider), and never attended an ELI appointment. Demographic, medical, and social data were extracted from each patient’s medical record, including comorbid conditions such as musculoskeletal pain and past medical interventions such as obesity counseling. Reported comorbidities and conditions in family medical histories were documented for each patient according to the organ system affected. Associations between clinical and family factors and follow-up status were evaluated using the χ2 test, Fisher exact test, 1-way analysis of variance, and Kruskal-Wallis H test in SPSS.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: The majority of patients were Hispanic (n=73, 60.3%) and male (n=65, 53.7%), with an average age of 7.81 years (+ SD, 3.82 yrs). Frequency of obesity counseling from a healthcare provider and reported musculoskeletal pain differed significantly among groups. 31% of patients with timely follow-up experienced musculoskeletal pain compared to 3% of those with no follow-up and late follow-up. In addition, patients in the timely follow-up group had the highest frequencies of obesity counseling. The organ systems-based approach of conditions in family histories showed cardiovascular disease and endocrine disorders to be present in all patient groups with no significant difference across groups.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: The results suggest that providers who document counseling their patients about childhood obesity more frequently prior to ELI referral can improve their patients’ follow-up rates. Additionally, musculoskeletal pain was the only comorbidity significantly associated with attending ELI clinic. This suggests that most comorbid conditions associated with childhood obesity have a limited effect on motivating parent/patient behavior to seek longitudinal intervention."],

      abstract: ["BACKGROUND: Multiple studies of hepatitis C virus (HCV) reported that 75% of individuals infected with HCV were born between 1945-1965 and were previously never tested. Therefore, in 2012 the CDC published recommendations that all individuals in this birth cohort should be screened for HCV at least once. Adherence to treatment is essential to achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR) for HCV cure. Patients who do not complete the treatment are at risk of treatment failure. The Adherence to Refills and Medication Scale (ARMS) has been an effective tool for predicting adherence of medication treatment in cardiovascular disease and diabetes and identifying risk factors associated with nonadherence to treatment for these diseases. The purpose of this study is to elucidate which risk factors significantly influence the ARMS score among this birth cohort at risk for HCV to guide future HCV treatment protocol adherence.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: This study recruited patients born between 1945-1965 and accessing care at the OU Physicians-Tulsa Family Medicine clinic between March-July 2019. Data was collected using a prescreening survey consisting of demographics, questions related to HCV risk factors (blood transfusions, tattoos, and intravenous drug use), depression assessed with the PHQ9 tool, and adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). IVDU, ACEs, and PHQ9 were classified into groups. Mean ARMS scores were compared using t-tests for variables with two categories and analysis of variance for variables with three or more categories. All statistical analyses were performed in SAS 9.4.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Among the 75 participants in the study, most were women (57%) and the sample had a mean ARMS score of 16.32 (SD=3.45). About half reported depression (51%) and one-third reported four or more ACEs (33%). Mean ARMS scores were 2.983 points (95% CI: 0.70-5.26) higher among those with moderate depression (PHQ 5-14), and 2.699 points (95% CI: 0.65-4.75) higher among those with severe depression (PHQ 15-27) than those with a minimal depression (PHQ 0-4). Similarly, mean ARMS score was 2.61 points (95% CI: 0.34-4.88) higher among those with at least four ACEs compared to those with three ACEs or less. Mean ARMS scores did not differ for any other variables.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: This is the first study to assess the ARMS score as a predictor of medication adherence and risk factors associated with the ARMS score in this high-risk birth cohort for HCV infection. These findings indicate that depression and ACEs may be risk factors for poor medication adherence in this population."],

This study evaluates early outcomes after bariatric surgery in patients with CLD with and without liver cirrhosis (LC).\r\n\r\nMETHODS: In a retrospective analysis of 2012–2016 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project-National Inpatient Sample, adult patients with obesity undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) were studied. CLD and LC were identified along with patient comorbidities. Outcomes were Long Hospital Stay (LHS) defined as ≥5 days (as a proxy of complicated course), blood product transfusion, total hospital charges, and in-hospital mortality. Binary logistic regression was used for multivariate analysis (MVA).\r\n\r\nRESULTS: 139,952 patients were analyzed (RYGB 36.6%, female 78.6%, age 44.7±12 years). CLD was listed in 17,423 (12.4%) patients, including 818 (0.6%) with LC. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease was the most common cause of CLD. Patients with LC were more likely to be older, male, and have diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia. 37.7% of LC and 42.1% of non-cirrhotic CLD patients underwent RYGB. Transfusion, LHS, and total charges were higher in the LC group (Table). In-hospital mortality was higher in CLD (0.1%) and LC (<0.3%). In MVA, LC was an independent predictor of LHS (Odds Ratio (OR): 1.82, 95% CI: 1.25-2.67) but non-cirrhotic CLD was not a predictor of LHS. Subgroup MVA in CLD showed RYGB was independently associated with LHS (OR: 1.85, 95% CI: 1.53-2.25).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: Bariatric surgery can be performed safely in appropriately selected patients with non-cirrhotic CLD and LC. Further studies are needed to assess long-term outcomes of bariatric surgery in CLD."],

The assessment tool will address a gap in performance measurement systems of healthcare providers and patient surveys about soft skills that most influence the way service is delivered and perceived during provider-patient interactions. In this study, the Iceberg Model of Managerial Competencies was used to define the construct and develop a conceptual model of soft skills. Soft skills are commonly referred to as bedside manner.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: The study implemented a mixed methods approach. The first phase used qualitative focus groups and semi-structured personal interviews to collect primary data from 62 participants from users (n=35) and providers (n=27) of healthcare services using a purposeful and snowball sampling strategies. Quantitative surveys were utilized to examine content and face validity. The first refined draft of the assessment tool was developed and obtained content and face validity through conducting qualitative focus groups and semi-structured personal interviews with six subject matter experts and a quantitative survey of 14 individuals representing users of healthcare services. Subject matter experts were recruited using purposeful sampling strategy, and users of healthcare services were recruited using availability sample from the target population. Ongoing data collection using a quantitative survey will further inform the factorial structure of the scale.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Ten soft skills were identified as the most essential soft skills for provider-patient interaction in primary care setting. A pool of 198 items were generated from the content analysis process. The final refined draft of the assessment tool consists of 49 items rated on 6-point Likert-type scale, measuring Verbal (personal) and non-verbal communication (15 items), empathy (5 items), compassion (4 items), caring (6 items), listening (5 items), respect (4 items), friendliness (4 items), and trust (6 items).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: The scale obtained excellent content validity with S-CVI/Ave = .96, and S-CVI/UA = .92.

      abstract: ["BACKGROUND: Adolescence is a period of rapid emotional, behavioral, social, and physiological change in a child’s development. Evidence is conclusive that teens are more likely to engage and revisit their provider in a confidential setting. Parents frequently express hesitancy or opposition when asked to leave the room for the confidential portion of the visit. Studies have shown that while 89% of parents believe that adolescents should speak to a provider one-on-one, about 61% of parents wish to be in the exam room for the entire visit.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this quality improvement project was to determine if parental perceptions and understanding of confidentiality in the adolescent visit could be improved by providing an informational letter before the clinical visit.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: A letter that defined adolescent confidentiality was created and addressed to parents regarding their child(ren)’s transition to adolescent care. This letter, along with a pre- and post-letter survey, was given to parents at annual adolescent well-visits. The survey assessed attitudes and knowledge related to adolescent confidentiality. The knowledge section asked parents to define confidentiality in the adolescent context. The responses were graded as “correct,” “partially correct,” and “incorrect.” Three Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles were completed, revising the succinctness and clarity of the letter and the survey in between each cycle. This yielded a total of 64 responses between spring 2018 and fall 2019.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Across all PDSA cycles, the letter was reportedly easy to read. A 60% and 17% increase in parental favorability regarding adolescent confidentiality was seen in cycles 1 and 2. Letter clarity and succinctness were not correlated with parental perceptions, indicating little association between letter “improvements” and parental perceptions. Parental understanding of confidentiality was mixed. With each cycle, there was no significant correlation between reading the letter and likelihood of choosing the most “correct” answer. However, a 25% and 100% increase in combined “slightly correct” and “correct” answers in 2 of 3 cycles was seen. There was also an average 34% decrease of “incorrect” answers across all 3 cycles.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: An explanatory letter may advance parents’ understanding and appreciation for adolescent autonomy; however, there is room for improvement in both areas, which will require alternative interventions."],

      abstract: ["BACKGROUND: Early childhood is a crucial period for children who are dual language learners (DLLs), struggling to learn the new language as well as other skills for school readiness. In contrast to comprehensive research in ECE, there are relatively few studies conducted with DLLs, and mainly for the Latino DLLs, no other language groups. Recently, Myanmar migrants are growing rapidly and make up 25% of the total migrant population in Tulsa (NBC news, 2017). Previous studies have shown that DLL children differ in various developmental outcomes because of a myriad of factors including poverty, systemic racism, and oppression. The researchers examined the classroom experiences of Myanmar children in a Head Start program by measuring their individual language use and level of engagement then, comparing them to other racial groups.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: The participants included 3- and 4-year-old children (n=1,101) in a Head Start program in Northeast OK. The measure used the Child Observational Protocol, which involved 3-second sweeps which snapshots of individual children’s behavior across a period of time in the classroom. Observers spent approximately 4 hours in the classroom on a typical morning. All children in the classroom were observed and had an average of 9 sweeps per child. The current study specifically focused on the proportion of sweeps in which a child was listening to or talking to someone else in the classroom (in any language) and the proportion of sweeps a child was observed speaking in English. Descriptive analyses were conducted using ANOVA in SPSS.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Results indicated that children who speak Myanmar at home had fewer times observational sweeps in which they were speaking in English (15%) compared to their African American and White peers (19-20%). However, whereas Latino children were observed more frequently to be neither speaking nor listening (45% of sweeps), Myanmar children were not significantly different than their Latino peers. Instead, Myanmar children were more likely to engage in passive instruction (15%) than their African American (10%) and White (12%) peers.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that Myanmar children who were enrolled in a Head Start program had bit fewer opportunities to practice their language skills and are less likely to be engaged in their classroom activities. Further research is needed to see whether these outcomes are due to language proficiency, cultural aspects, or influenced by others. This information also leads to the need for further study of how teachers interact in the classroom based on the racial groups."],

      abstract: ["BACKGROUND: Unexpected events or outcomes in healthcare that create considerable harm or lasting damage to a patient are called adverse patient events (Mira et al., 2015). Providers affected by such events are called “second victims.” The current study examined personal and organizational outcomes related to involvement in adverse events including psychological and physical symptoms, burnout, and employee withdrawal behaviors.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: Participants were recruited through social media sites. The population of interest was healthcare providers who potentially had been involved in an adverse event. Consent to participate was given by 204 individuals of which 127 were current or former healthcare providers. The remaining 77 respondents were excluded from the study.\r\n\r\nAll measures were self-report and administered online through Qualtrics. All scales demonstrated acceptable internal consistency reliability. First, burnout was measured using the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (Demourti et al., 2003). Participants were then asked if they had experienced an adverse patient event. Individuals who affirmed having such an experience were considered second victims and remained in the study; participation from other healthcare respondents was complete at that point. Responses to items from the second victim experience and support tool developed by Burlison and colleagues (2017) were collected from the second victims. Factor analytic work and internal consistency reliability analyses resulted in three factors: “personal distress,” “organizational support,” and “withdrawal behaviors.”\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Results indicated that second victims had significantly higher rates of burnout (M=3.88, SD=.97) than did other healthcare providers (M=3.46, SD=.84), t(119)=-2.07, p<.05. Results also revealed personal distress was significantly positively correlated with both burnout (r=.56) and withdrawal behaviors (r=.56) while perceptions of organizational support were significantly negatively correlated with both burnout (r=-.46) and withdrawal behaviors (r=-.35). A mediation model tested using Hayes SPSS PROCESS macro revealed the negative relationship between organizational support and withdrawal behaviors was partially mediated by burnout. Percent mediation was 52.9%.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: This study has important implications for healthcare organizations. Adverse patient experiences were related to higher likelihood of provider burnout and withdrawal behaviors. Perceptions of organizational support, however, were inversely related to these outcomes. Results suggest healthcare organizations should prioritize support mechanisms for second victims to potentially mitigate undesirable employee and organizational outcomes related to adverse patient events. Due to the cross-sectional design of the study, causal relationships between involvement in adverse events and these consequences cannot be assumed however, thus, further research is suggested."],

      abstract: ["BACKGROUND: Infectious disease comprises 7% of the American Board of Pediatrics general pediatrics board exam and covers hundreds of different organisms that cause disease. Covering each of these topics all together in one presentation at our weekly academic afternoon quickly becomes overwhelming.  Additionally, we understand residents have dozens of other responsibilities. Our aim was to develop a longitudinal weekly curriculum that could be replicated at other programs that would deliver the required material to all residents, allow residents to cover material quickly at their own pace, and improve Infectious Disease sub-scores on the in training exam. \r\n\r\nMETHODS: Starting in summer 2019, the Pediatrics and Medicine-Pediatrics chiefs at University of Oklahoma-Tulsa School of Community Medicine have developed a longitudinal infectious disease curriculum that uses technology to aid in education. Every week, a short board-style quiz is released to the residents via Google Classroom, which gets pushed directly to the phones of our residents. Each week a different organism or group of organisms is covered, focusing on the most common organisms on the test. Google classroom allows us to attach study guides, the appropriate Red Book chapters, and YouTube videos that explain each topic, allowing for residents to review topics and answer questions at their own pace.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: We have recommended, but have not required our 24 residents to complete each assignment. Since beginning the project, 58% of our residents have completed at least 75% of the assignments with an average score of 70%.  Initial participation was robust, but as the busy winter season approached, participation rates decreased. Reminder notifications, and an incentive was introduced in the winter which temporarily improved participation from 54% to 75-83%. Our academic benchmark is to measure average infectious disease In-Training Exam sub-scores per class in comparison to our baseline test in June 2018 and 2019. \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: Educating residents on infectious disease as a year-long longitudinal curriculum has the potential to be an effective way to present material relevant to the ABP General Pediatrics exam. Providing this content as an mobile-app based curriculum allows for self-pacing and interactive content. Our first cycles have shown residents will voluntarily participate in this curriculum and the seasonal limitations of voluntary participation, with possible steps programs could take to improve participation.  The extent to which this curriculum improves ITE sub-scores will be determined at the next exam this summer. We hope this information can be used by other programs wishing to implement similar curricula."],

      abstract: ["BACKGROUND: National trends show that employees and trainees in the medical field are susceptible to burnout. To our knowledge, no studies have been published on burnout moderators, such as perceived support and lifestyle behaviors. This study is part of a larger, longitudinal investigation examining the relationships among burnout, levels of perceived stress, levels of perceived support (social and organizational), and several lifestyle behaviors for faculty, staff, residents, fellows, and students at the OU-TU School of Community Medicine (OUSCM).\r\n\r\nMETHODS: Investigators sent an email survey to every member of the OUSCM in April 2019. It included validated measures such as the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), University of Delaware Survey of Perceived Organizational Support, and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, alongside questions about lifestyle behaviors. MBI subscores of exhaustion and cynicism were stratified in the analysis. SPSS software was used to conduct Pearson correlations among these variables.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: 318 responses were collected (35% response rate), with respondents’ demographic data representing the white (67.7%), women (78.1%), and staff (57.2%) members of the population. Among the whole sample, levels of perceived organizational support had a moderate negative correlation relative to burnout subscores of exhaustion (r=-.556, p<0.001) and cynicism (r=-.558, p<0.001). Likewise, levels of perceived social support had a weak negative correlation to exhaustion (r= -.169, p = 0.008) and cynicism (r= -.233, p<0.001). Among the disaggregated subgroups of students and faculty, moderate negative correlations were found between perceived social support and burnout subscores. Social support had a moderate negative correlation only with cynicism among students (r= -.453, p=0.006), while social support had moderate negative correlations with both exhaustion (r=-.514 p<0.001) and cynicism (-.555, p<0.001) among faculty. There were no significant relationships found between these two variables among staff members and resident physician subgroups.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: Because of a low response rate, our sample’s demographics may not be representative of our populations and may potentially limit generalization based on these results. However, the significant correlations found in whole sample analysis between perceived organizational and social support relative to burnout suggest that these variables may lessen the effects of burnout in our population. Moreover, subgroup analysis suggests that social support is a more important potential mitigator of burnout only in students and faculty, when compared to staff and residents. Furthermore, this finding supports that burnout levels within distinct subgroups of our population may be mitigated by different variables."],

Teachers who do integrate technology into their educational practices understand that it is not an end-all solution, but rather a support to their current pedagogical and content practices. However, a simple question remains among current early childhood educators, how can technology be effectively used and integrated into classroom environments in order to facilitate children’s learning and development? Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore how pre-service teachers (PSTs) integrated technology (a translation app) into their lessons and how students (or dual language learners) responded to the use of this technology. The study was guided by the following research questions:   \r\n\r\n1. How do pre-service teachers integrate Speak & Translate with dual language learners?  \r\n2. Based on PST's observations, how do dual language learners respond to the use of Speak & Translate? \r\n\r\nMETHODS: This qualitative, phenomenological research study was conducted in a teacher preparation program in the Midwest. Thirty-one female PSTs participated in the study. During their field placement experience, each PST taught 3 small group lessons with preschool children using the Speak & Translate (S&T) app. After each lesson was taught, PSTs completed a lesson reflection that was uploaded into Dedoose. Analysis included level 1 (priori coding) and level 2 (thematic coding) in order to analyze the reflections and explore PST’s use of S&T with DLLs and how DLLs responded to this experience.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Across all lessons, S&T was utilized a total of 46 times and was primarily used to translate key vocabulary of the lesson or content of the book. PSTs also used the app to model an activity, model material use, and provide instructions and directions. The most exciting finding was the changes PST’s noticed in DLL’s body language, engagement, and motivation when they used the app in their lessons.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: PSTs were asked to focus on the integration of technology (S&T), which produced a lesson that met all aspects of the TPACK framework. Based on PST’s reflections, they not only experienced a shift in their own thinking and pedagogical approaches, but they also noticed a shift in DLLs’ engagement and motivation during their technology supported lessons. Findings from this study hold promising and important educational implications for pedagogical practices not only for PSTs, but also for current educators who work with DLLs."],

There continues to be variation in treatment practices by physicians in the United States despite guidelines establishing the use of antivenom and supportive care as the mainstays for treating crotaline snake envenomation.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: This study sought to determine associations between physician treatment strategies, snake identification (ID), venom effects, bite location and patient presentation. A cross-sectional review of electronic medical records (EMR) for patients diagnosed with venomous snake bites from July 1, 2014 to August 31, 2019 was completed. Data collected from the EMR included: patient demographics, transfer information, length of hospital and ICU stays, snake ID, bite site, progression of local tissue effects, additional clinical and lab results, patient comorbidities and complications, and provider treatment strategy.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Of the 83 patients who met inclusion criteria, 68 patients (81.9%) received antivenom. None of the 15 patients who were under observation (no antivenom) for treatment went to the ICU. These patients experienced the shortest hospital stays (H(2)=16.76, p<0.001). Hospital stays were longest for patients envenomated by an identified rattlesnake or cottonmouth compared to patients envenomated by an unknown snake or copperhead (H(2)=14.32, p<0.05). Rattlesnake envenomations used more vials of antivenom than copperhead envenomations (H(2)=8.76, p=0.01). In a regression model of treatment strategy, progression of local tissue effects was the only statistically significant predictor of receiving antivenom while other independent variables including snake ID, patient age, hemotoxicity, systemic symptoms, site of the snakebite, and patient comorbidities were not significant predictors. Lastly, there was a statistically significant association between treatment strategy and opioid prescription, with 77.9% of patients who received antivenom also receiving an opioid for pain management vs. 33.3% of patients under observation (no antivenom) who received opioids (Fisher Exact Probability Test, p=0.001).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: Envenomated patients are likely to be treated with antivenom if there was progression of local tissue effects. For patients in this study who were bitten by copperheads and unknown snakes, close observation without antivenom administration had favorable outcomes including shorter hospital stays and likely decreased hospital costs."],

Follow-up appointments are an ideal time to provide education, address concerns, and arrange for continuity of care. \r\nThis quality improvement (QI) study aimed to improve the percentages of primary care clinic follow-up within 7 days of hospital discharge.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: Using the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) Model for Improvement, a multidisciplinary team examined pre-implementation data for patients discharged from the children’s hospital in February 2018. Electronic medical record (EMR) review was performed to determine if follow-up appointments were scheduled and attended within 7 days of discharge. Four week PDSA cycles were then completed by the medical residents, pediatric hospitalists and a care transition coordinator. Cycle 1 (n=25) involved developing an EMR-based shared patient list to identify all patients needing follow-up. In Cycle 2 (n=69), monthly standardized resident education was implemented to optimize use of the shared patient list. In Cycle 3 (n=81), a discharge appointment template was used to schedule appointments for patients discharged on weekends.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Percent of appointments scheduled increased throughout the PDSA cycles from baseline (baseline - 60%; cycle 1 - 72%; cycle 2 - 74%; cycle 3 - 85%), as well as percent of appointments attended (baseline - 56%; cycle 1 - 56%; cycle 2 - 61%; cycle 3 - 70%) with p<0.001. Clinic follow-up was lower for patients with chronic illnesses but did improve from cycle 1 (42%) to cycle 3 (67%). The percentage of appointments scheduled for weekend discharges was not significantly different from weekday discharges, and increased from baseline over the course of the PDSA cycles.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: The number of follow-up appointments both scheduled and attended increased throughout the study, suggesting that the QI measures implemented were effective. Further interventions will focus on patient and system barriers to appointment attendance."],

The vision for Camp HOPE America is to break the generational cycle of family violence by offering healing and hope to children who have witnessed such violence. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the camp's effectiveness at increasing hope and resilience in youth after participating in Camp HOPE.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: This study utilized pre, post and thirty day follow-up surveys from 1,127 campers at twenty-eight camp sites across fifteen states and their counselors’ observations to examine hope and resilience factors. The surveys were conducted a few days before camp, during camp, and approximately thirty days after the camp ended. To assess hope, the Children’s Hope Scale (Snyder et al., 1997) was utilized to examine the extent to which children believe they can establish pathways to their goals as well as develop and maintain the willpower to follow these pathways. On the first and last day of camp, counselors also provided assessments of 1,063 campers using the Children's Hope Scale, reworded to reflect this observational approach. Following the Camp HOPE America theme of believing in yourself, believing in others and believing in your dreams, OU's Hope Research Center created six items to assess each child's self-reported resiliency. For both hope and resilience, a six point Likert-type response format was utilized (1=none of the time; 6=all of the time).\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Hope and Resiliency scores increased from pre-camp test to at-camp test and again at the 30-day follow-up assessment. Repeated measures ANOVAS showed that the increase was statistically significant for both hope [F(2,781)=36.80; p<.001] and resilience [F (2, 769)=26.34; p<.001]. In regard to hope observed by the camp counselors, a repeated measures ANOVA was computed to examine the differences in pre-camp and at-camp test mean scores [t(1062)=-16.66; p<.001] and showed that individuals' levels of observable hope increased after participating in Camp HOPE America.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: The results of this study provide compelling evidence that Camp HOPE improves the hope of children exposed to domestic violence and their resilience. This study serves to evaluate the success of current camp programming and will inform future curriculum and programming for Camp HOPE America. It also serves to stimulate further interest in organizations' ability to nourish hope and resilience in children impacted by domestic violence."],

      abstract: ["BACKGROUND:  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) introduced Comprehensive Primary Care Plus (CPC+) to improve the quality of primary care services nationwide. CPC+ utilization measures use a risk-adjustment model to predict utilization for different patient populations. Risk is determined using Hierarchical Condition Categories (HCCs), which are based on ICD-10 codes and patient demographics. Since patients with higher HCC scores are expected to have higher utilization rates, CMS uses these calculations to compare practices and categorize patients into “risk tiers,” which guide payments. OUSCM participates in CPC+ (Track 2). In order to track our patients’ emergency department utilization (EDU), search for patterns of use, and identify opportunities for quality improvement, we sought to determine (1) what associations exist between HCC risk tiers and patterns of EDU and (2) what patient characteristics are associated with HCC risk scores.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional CPC+ data for fiscal year 2018 provided by CMS. We performed multiple linear regression, Tukey’s method, and independent-samples t-tests to explore possible relationships between EDU, HCC risk score and associated risk tiers (range 1-5), and patient characteristics, such as dual-eligibility status and age. The study population included 906 Medicare-only and 1173 dual-eligible patients aged 18 years and older attributed to the OUSCM Internal Medicine (n=1122) or Family Medicine (n=957) practice.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Our patient population had a median HCC risk score of 0.93 (CMS-reported Oklahoma median risk score = 0.74). We found that 56.4% of our patients were dual-eligible compared to the national average of 19.4%. Tukey multiple comparison test demonstrated significant differences between risk tiers and ED visits (p < .05). Dual-eligible patients had a higher average HCC risk score than Medicare-only patients (t(2072) = 8.491; p < .00001) and a higher average number of ED visits (t(2077) = 3.9577; p < .00001). Age was weakly correlated with HCC risk scores (r = .074, p = .0228). Density analysis of HCC scores by age revealed evidence of low-risk clustering for adults between 45 and 75 years of age.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: HCC risk tier classifications are predictive of EDU rates in our patient population. However, our overall HCC score was lower than anticipated given the complexity of our patient population. Dual-eligible status was associated with higher risk and EDU rates. However, age–typically an independent predictor of morbidity and mortality–was only weakly correlated with HCC scores, suggesting clinicians may be undercoding encounters for adults between the ages of 45 and 75 years, which decreases revenue."],

      abstract: ["BACKGROUND: Oklahoma’s failure to protect law, which holds non-offending caregivers who fail to report maltreatment to the same standard as perpetrators, has received increased scrutiny at the national level. This is in part due to cases such as Tondalao Hall, a mother from Oklahoma City who was sentenced to 30 years in prison for failing to report child maltreatment while the perpetrator, who was also allegedly abusing Hall, was sentenced to two years in jail with credit for time served and probation. Due to the increased focus for criminal justice reform in Oklahoma the investigators sought to evaluate gender disparities in the criminal court outcomes of child maltreatment cases investigated by a multidisciplinary team.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted of defendants of 151 medically diagnosed child maltreatment cases from 2013–2014. Data included both clinical data from the University of Oklahoma Electronic Medical Record as well as publicly accessible data from the Tulsa District Attorney’s Office and Oklahoma State Courts Network. Only defendants with criminal cases prosecuted within Tulsa County were considered for analysis. Expunged cases were also excluded from analysis. To test for associations between gender and court outcomes, chi-square tests of independence were used in SPSS, version 25.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: There were a total of 138 defendants, with a slightly male majority (n=76, 55.1%). There was a significant association between gender and neglect charges (χ2(1)=3.96, p<0.046), with 46.8% of females charged with neglect vs. 30.3% of males. There was also a significant association between gender and verdict type (χ2(1)=14.35, p<0.001), with a greater percentage of females (43.5%) receiving deferred verdicts than males (15.8%). Conversely, a greater percentage of males (71.1%) received guilty verdicts than females (41.9%). Gender was also associated with incarceration being included in sentencing (χ2(1)=6.63, p<0.01), with a greater percentage of males (56.6%) receiving jail/prison time than females (35.5%).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: The results indicate that males within the cohort typically received higher rates of guilty verdicts, fewer deferred sentences, and harsher sentencing outcomes, such as incarceration. Notably more females than males were charged with neglect (46.8%); however, the difference between convictions for neglect by gender was not statistically significant. Further research regarding criminal court outcomes in child maltreatment cases is still needed to fully understand the impact of failure to protect laws across the entire state."],

      abstract: ["Today’s scholars have more publishing options available to them than ever before. In addition to traditional publishing venues, open publishing has become a viable and practicable option for communicating research to ever broadening audiences. This breadth of publishing options focuses new attention on the way business models, accessibility, copyright and intellectual property, and research dissemination are envisioned. Moreover, these considerations have important and pressing implications for OU faculty members and graduate students who are authors, readers, reviewers, editors, society associates, and advisory board members dependent upon effective scholarly communication for professional development and advancement. Scholars are on the cusp of a transformative shift toward a more sustainable system of scholarly communication. In 2019 the University Libraries Committee convened a Scholarly Communication Taskforce to examine these issues. The Taskforce met during the 2019-2020 and will continue their work through the spring of 2022. The Taskforce has met monthly to discuss selected readings and how these scholarly communication topics will effect their colleagues and students in their colleges and departments.The Taskforce's work culminated in this report \"Finding the Balance: Creating an Open Sustainable Future for OU,\" to be presented to the OU community. For more information, visit the Taskforce website at https://bit.ly/SCTFReport."],

As stated in the SHAREOK Preservation Support Policy, OU Libraries is committed to preserving the binary form of the digital object of content deposited in SHAREOK. As resources permit, OU Libraries will also take further measures to preserve as much functionality (\"look and feel\") of the original content as possible. The Recommended File Formats table outlines the file formats that have a high, medium, and low probability of full preservation.  The files in the left-hand column have a high probability of full preservation. Those in the right-hand column have a low probability of being fully preserved over time. Those formats in the middle are preferred over their counterparts in the right-hand column, but assurance of their long-term preservation is not as high as the left-hand column. We recommend that those depositing content in SHAREOK use formats in the left-hand column of the table if at all possible and consider methods for converting files with low probability to formats with higher probability.

      abstract: ["Loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) seedlings from 12 full-sib families were obtained from a 6-parent half diallel mating design. These seedlings were challenged using two inocula of the fusiforn rust fungus( Cronartium quercuum f.sp. fusiforme) at extremely high spore density (250,000sp/ml ~ 300,000sp/ml) with replications in the greenhouse (concentrated basidiospore spray method). Each basidiospore inoculum originated from a mixed gall collection of aeciospores obtained from field-infected trees. Presence or absence of rust galls was recorded at four and half months & nine months after inoculation and infection percentages were calculated. The rust infection rates were high for every full-sib family and were above 90% for most of full-sib families for both inocula. However, the infection in family of 28-321 by 28-301progeny was relatively lower. The analysis showed that the rust infection of 28-321 by 28-301progeny was not significant different from 75% for both inocula. Two pairs of complementary genes could explain the observed percent infection levels in this diallel based on a gene-for-gene hypothesis. The 75% infection in the full-sib family of 28-321 by 28-301 may be explained by epistasis between two resistance genes. The putative genotypes of host parents and virulence compositions of mixed inocula were postulated. A bulk-segregrant analysis based on phenotype (gall vs no gall) was used to search for dominant molecular markers associated with the potential resistance genes in the host parents. Few candidate marker polymorphisms were observed between the gall vs no gall bulks and none of the candidates co-segregated with phenotype when tested across the progeny set."],

Two intra-provenance (CxC and PxP) and two inter-provenance (CxP and PxC) populations were generated. Twenty polymix families represented each population. Main objectives of the study were to: (1) determine whether the inter-provenance hybrids can combine the growth of Atlantic Coastal and the cold hardiness of Piedmont sources when planted in Piedmont regions, (2) characterize the genetic architecture among and within populations across and within Piedmont regions, and (3) evaluate the stability of performance of families within populations across different environments. The performance of inter-provenance hybrids was intermediate to that of the parental populations. When compared to the Piedmont population, which is the commonly planted source in Piedmont regions because of its cold hardiness, CxP inter-provenance hybrids exhibited significantly better height growth, with superiority ranging among 0.16% to 5.81% for height. Survival differences among populations within Piedmont regions were not significant at this age, except in the Cold Area, where significantly higher survival was found for the Piedmont population. There were large family differences within populations for growth and survival. Genetic control for growth traits varied among populations, with stronger additive genetic control for CxP hybrids. Considerable variation was also detected for family performance for growth and stability across sites. The CxC and CxP populations were more responsive to site quality increase (measured by the test means), with a higher percentage of families having regression slopes larger than 1.0. This early evaluation showed some promise for using loblolly pine hybrids as planting stock in the Piedmont region. With additional testing for cold hardiness, there is a potential to combine the growth of Atlantic Coastal and the adaptation to cold of Piedmont sources for planting in Piedmont regions. The CxP hybrids may perform well in milder Piedmont environments, while PxC could be more suitable for more inland and north Piedmont regions. Long-term monitoring of population performance and survival is essential, as prolonged exposure to adverse climatic conditions will provide more confidence about the results."],

These 43 realized gain trials consisted of three types: 1) rust resistant and rust susceptible material growing in high rust hazard sites in the Best Management Practices study (5 trials), 2) material selected for growth by the Cooperative Forest Genetics Research Program at the University of Florida (19 trials), and 3) Improved and unimproved material established by the Plantation Management Research Cooperative at the University of Georgia (19 trials). All trials contained slash pine seedlots collected from unrogued or lightly rogued first generation seed orchards. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to validate predicted breeding values calculated for each seedlot considering pollen background. Observed realized gains for each seedlot were used as the dependent variable, while site variables (site index and rust hazard) along with the predicted breeding values were used as independent variables. BLP values predicted for rust resistance were reasonably accurate, and most of the known variation in rust incidence was accounted for by the predicted breeding values. Conversely, validation of BLP-predicted volume breeding values was difficult due to excessive noise in the data for individual tree volume and stand yield. The use of highly replicated medium-size rectangular plots is suggested to overcome this problem of imprecise field data from realized gain trials."],

      abstract: ["Diallel mating designs are widely used in plant improvement programs to estimate additive and dominance genetic variances, and to provide a base population for advanced selection. It is very common to limit the number of parents in a diallel small (4-8) in order to keep the number of crosses in a manageable size and complete the diallel breeding within a short time period. Many such diallels are created in a breeding program, and often are disconnected. Thus there are generally large sampling errors among diallels for genetic variance components. In this study, we examined variation in estimates of variance components and heritabilities of two loblolly pine breeding populations. Over 100 diallels (105) from the Coastal breeding population and and 114 from Piedmont breeding populations were examined for the distribution of these parameters. Frequency distribution of GCA variance and narrow-sense heritability showed an approximate normal distribution, while SCA variance showed a considerable skewness and displayed a significant departure from normality. Genetic parameter estimates fluctuated considerably from one diallel to another as expected due to the effect of the small population size. Individual heritability ranged from 0.0 to 0.62 in the Coastal breeding population and from 0.0 to 0.52 in the Piedmont population. Some theoretical considerations regarding to the optimum sample size to estimate reliable genetic parameters from diallel tests were addressed."],

      abstract: ["Nineteen families of susceptible and resistant pine parent species and their interspecific hybrid progenies were quantitatively assessed for Nantucket pine tip moth (Rhyacionia frustrana Comstock) damage in a study in southeast Mississippi. The seeds for this study were leftover from previously performed experiments and the collection did not provide for a balanced set of families. However, it did include seven slash pine families, two shortleaf families, two loblolly families, three three-way hybrid families, one testcross hybrid family, and two F1 hybrid families of susceptible and resistant parents. The loblolly (L1 and L2) and shortleaf (Sf1 and Sf2) pine parents were susceptible, while the slash (S1 to S7) parents were resistant. The hybrids were produced from controlled pollinations that included eight additional parent trees along with the S1 slash pine parent and both of the shortleaf (Sf1 and Sf2) parents. The eight additional parent species included two F1 hybrid parents; one of which was a slash x longleaf, combining two resistant parent species and the other was a longleaf x shortleaf, combining a resistant and a susceptible parent species. The F1 hybrids in this study were the progeny of the S1 slash parent and a loblolly parent. The three-way hybrids were the progeny of the slash x longleaf F1 hybrid parent and the Sf1 and Sf2 plus one additional shortleaf parent, while the testcross hybrid was produced from the longleaf x shortleaf F1 hybrid parent and a slash pine parent. The F1 hybrid families and the three-way hybrid families were susceptible to tip moth attack like their susceptible loblolly and shortleaf parents, but tip moth damage on all of these families was significantly higher than that on the slash pine parent and testcross hybrid families. The phenotypes of the pure species and hybrid families supports a dominant mode of inheritance for susceptibility to tip moth in three different ways: (1) the phenotype of the F1 hybrids expressed the phenotype of the susceptible parents, (2) the phenotype of the three-way hybrids expressed the phenotype of the susceptible shortleaf parents when those parents were crossed with an interspecific F1 hybrid of two resistant parents, and (3) the testcross hybrid expressed a level of susceptibility that was intermediate to that of the susceptible and resistant parents when the longleaf x shortleaf F1 hybrid parent was backcrossed to a resistant slash pine parent."],

Of the 360 selections, two-thirds are forward selections (selections made in 1400 second-cycle full-sib selection plots) and one-third are backward selections (excellent first- and second-cycle selections brought forward into the third cycle). Selections will be top-grafted into sexually-mature, insect-protected, seed orchard trees where third-cycle breeding can begin as soon as one year after grafting. The main breeding population is divided into ten sublines with approximately 36 selections per subline. The top 6 selections from each of the 10 sublines comprise an elite population (6 per subline x 10 sublines = 60 elite selections). The ten sublines are divided into two superlines (the orange and blue superlines). Each superline has 5 sublines containing a total 180 selections of which 30 comprise the elite population for that superline. The breeding for the main and elite populations is scheduled for three breeding seasons (2004-2006) and consists entirely of FS matings planted in replicated tests with single tree plots in incomplete block designs. For the elite population, a circular mating design will create 75 crosses in each of the 2 superlines (5 crosses for each of the 30 selections) for a total of 150 total elite FS families (75 crosses/superline x 2 superlines). Ten third-cycle elite FS progeny tests will be planted with each test having 3,000 measure trees (150 families/test x 20 blocks/test) for a total of 30,000 FS seedlings. For the main population, the circular mating design will attempt 72 crosses within each of the 10 sublines (averaging 4 crosses per selection) for a total of 720 main population crosses (72 crosses/subline x 10 sublines). Ten third-cycle main population FS progeny tests will be planted with each test containing FS progeny from half of the sublines (2 series with 5 tests for the orange subline and 5 for the blue). Assuming that only 600 of the 720 attempted FS families are successful, each test will contain 4,500 measure trees (300 families/test x 15 block/test of single tree plots) for a total of 45,000 FS progeny planted in main population tests (2 series * 5 tests/series * 4500 trees/test)."],

Graft incompatibility became evident by the early 1960s and dampened enthusiasm for grafted clonal orchards for this species A different approach, the IFA-PNW �Progressive Tree Improvement System� was launched in 1966. The emphasis here was on forming local cooperatives to share costs, and on progeny testing large numbers of trees using wind-pollinated seed in small testing zones. This phase ran from 1967 till 1993, during which over 26,000 first-generation parents were tested in 109 breeding units (between local cooperatives, the USDI Bureau of Land Management, the USDA Forest Service and WA Department of Natural Resources), with over 3 million progeny test trees planted. A second-generation breeding and testing strategy was developed between 1996 and 1997: Adjacent first-generation testing programs could merge to share genetic material for breeding and testing. Breeding population size for any merged programs should be at least 300 selections. Within a breeding population, breeding groups of 20-30 selections each would be used to manage inbreeding and create multiple populations. The top 10-20 percent of selections within a breeding population could also be assigned an elite population. A minimum of nine breeding groups would be needed within a given testing zone. Each new testing zone was to use all of the families from \"local\" breeding groups and only the most elite selections from breeding groups originating further away from the testing zone. Each selection would be used in at least two crosses. The committee proposed using three types of tests, each with a specific purpose and design: family-ranking/selection tests; longterm stability tests; and adaptability-screening tests. Breeding and testing is in various stages of completion for seven different programs, which would lead to nine or 10 testing zones. The rule of thumb in choosing selections (first-generation parents, forward selections from open-pollinated progeny tests and from full-sib orchards) crossed to form the second-generation populations has been a 1 in 10 between-family selection intensity. Most selections were based on age-15 height. Where available information on stem sinuosity, forking, ramicorn branches and wood specific gravity were also considered. Between five and six tests have been established per testing zone, with 20 trees planted per family per site in single-tree plots. Trials established to date have contained from 143 to 283 full-sib crosses. All tests are fenced to protect the seedlings from browse. Tests will probably be measured twice, around seven and 12 years from seed (or when the trees are 15 and 30 feet tall respectively)."],

As the third cycle selections are being completed, an efficient, cost effective, detailed breeding plan for third-cycle breeding is being finalized to ensure both the short- and long-term benefits for Cooperative members. While a general framework of the third cycle breeding plan has been suggested by a breeding and testing task force (Task Force Report 1992 and McKeand and Bridgwater 1998), only recently the detailed implementation plan has been finalized. Based on the results of research simulation and practical considerations of workload and logistical arrangements, an implementation plan for the third cycle breeding is outlined. Three general test zones will be used for the cooperative loblolly pine breeding program, i.e., 1) Northern: Virginia and northern NC, 2) Coastal: Atlantic coastal plain and Lower Gulf, and 3) Piedmont: Piedmont regions of SC and GA and Upper Gulf. A common pollen mix will be used within each zone for polycross breeding and evaluating 3rd cycle selections across sites within the zone. The mainline breeding population will be structured as sublines to manage genetic variation and inbreeding for long-term breeding. A complementary design of polycross and a modified diallel (smart diallel) will be used for mainline breeding. The polycross will be used to estimate breeding values to rank selections and followed by the smart diallel mating to provide the progeny for within-family selection. Polycross tests will be established with a single-tree plot design on different sites across the range within each zone, while smart diallel crosses will be planted in full-sib family blocks for within family selection. The best selections will be selected and bred intensively in an elite breeding population within each zone for short-term genetic gain."],

      abstract: ["Increasing the frequency of favorable alleles in populations is the goal of tree breeding based on an additive genetic model. Conceptually, marker based selection (MBS) combined with accelerated breeding offers a more efficient means to this end by reducing the generation interval and increasing genetic gain per generation. Yet, while DNA markers for qualitative and quantitative traits have been identified and reported, neither these nor other genetic markers have been widely accepted in southern pine breeding programs. Some of the reasons for not using MBS include the following: marker development and genotyping costs are too high, QTL effects appear too small and have not been demonstrated in independent families, and the requirement of multiple populations, traits and environment complicate matters such that there is no clear path forward. To address these theoretical and operational issues we are proposing two general strategies for MBS-accelerated southern pine breeding. One strategy applies QTL detection and marker selection to established breeding resources, while the other generates breeding populations structured to make optimal use of DNA marker information in an operational breeding context. Both strategies depend on performing multiple generations of selection prior to progeny testing. This is in contrast to the normal mode of operation in which selections are progeny tested each generation. We suggest that these strategies offer much flexibility with respect to moving selections to production populations and therefore should offer additional genetic gain at intermediate time points. Options for population structure and family sizes and for phenotypic and genotypic data requirements of each strategy will be discussed. Half-sib family designs are utilized in both strategies to capture linkage-disequilibrium of the constructed populations and to infer linkage phase relationships of marker and QTL alleles in individual families. Selective genotyping using highly informative DNA markers are required to reduce genotyping costs, while BLUP analyses are proposed to improve phenotypic data quality. Accelerated breeding options include top grafting or the use of a short generation pine species, such as Virginia pine, as a model species."],

One major 5S rDNA site was observed in an intercalary region of a metacentric chromosome that lacked 18S-28S rDNA sites. One or possibly two minor 5S rDNA sites were observed near the ends of two different chromosomes.

The greatest incidence of infection, on the other hand, is in the center of the distribution, exactly where the frequency of resistant genotypes is low. One might expect that the frequency of resistant genotypes would be higher where the disease is more prevalent, due to natural selection. It has been proposed that (1) fusiform rust resistance in loblolly pine in the west originates from hybridization with shortleaf pine. It is well known that shortleaf is resistant to fusiform rust, and it is also known that natural hybrids between the two species exist, and they seem to be more common in the west. (2) In the northeastern loblolly, it has been proposed that hybridization with pond pine is the source of resistance. Once again, natural hybridization between loblolly and pond pine is known to exist in the northeast, but not much is known about the relative resistance of pond pine to fusiform rust. Allozyme data was used to refute hypothesis (1) and cortical monoterpene data was used to refute hypothesis (2).

Green fluorescent protein has been introduced into three different loblolly pine families that are considered recalcitrant to transformation. The m-gfp5-ER gene produced bright-green fluorescence easily detectable and screenable in loblolly pine tissue 3-30 days after explants were cocultivated with Agrobacterium. A high-level of GFP expression was detected in transgenic cells, tissues, and plants, and was localized in specific cells derived from cotyledons, hypocotyls, and radicles of mature zygotic embryos. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo monitoring of GFP expression permitted a rapid and easy discrimination of transgenic shoots, and drastically reduced the quantity of tissue to be handled and the time required for the recovery of transformed plants. Integration of the m-gfp5-ER was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), by Southern and northern blot analysis, and by junction DNA sequence analysis. Molecular analysis of Agrobacterium T-DNA loci in transgenic loblolly pine demonstrated that most of transgenic plants were derived from single transformation events. GFP-expressing shoots were also observed in loblolly pine explants co-cultivated with Agrobacterium but cultured in a medium without the selective agent kanamycin.

      abstract: ["Loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) has been the focus of genetic improvement for nearly 100 years because of the value of this species to the forestry industry. The application of gene transfer technology to loblolly pine improvement has been limited by the regeneration of transgenic tissue into plants. We have developed gene transfer systems that allow the regeneration of trees after the transformation of embryogenic cultures from a large number of genetically diverse families. Genetic transformation was achieved by biolistic and Agrobacterium-mediated techniques. Biolistic transformation efficiency was increased by identifying the optimal target using secondary somatic embryogenesis and by determining the long-term effects of tissue culture manipulations. Improvements to selection and the tissue culture system facilitated the production of stable transformants from 72% of the cell lines attempted from 15 elite families, with an escape rate of less than 1%. Molecular analysis of transgenic trees produced from biolistic transformation found that 36% of the trees had three inserts or less. Transgenic trees produced by biolistics have exhibited normal morphology for up to five growing seasons, to date. An Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system was developed for loblolly pine using tissue culture and selection procedures of the biolistic system. Agrobacterium tumefaciens has been used to produce transgenic trees of clones from elite loblolly families, as well as clones of P. radiata and P. taeda x rigida. Genomic blot analysis of Agrobacterium-transformed somatic embryos is ongoing. Field tests with Agrobacterium-transformed loblolly and the hybrid loblolly have been established each year since 2001. The efficiency of the Agrobacterium transformation system has made it possible for ArborGen to scale-up for high-throughput gene testing in a conifer. Transgenic trees have been produced with genes for lignin modification, accelerated growth, and flowering control."],

Field performance of progeny from controlled crosses using an orchard pollen mix were compared to open-pollinated progeny.

The trials were assessed for volume production at 3, 5 and 8 years of age. Subsets of 13 and 5 provenances were assessed using RAPD and allozyme markers, respectively, to determine patterns of genetic diversity and mating systems in natural stands. RAPD analyses indicated significant differences among provenances in percent polymorphism and observed heterozygosity. Geographical location of the population in Mesoamerica greatly influenced genetic diversity, with populations from Mexico and Guatemala exhibiting more diversity than those from Honduras and Nicaragua. Observed heterozygosity patterns detected in the RAPD analysis correlated reasonably well with provenance performance in Brazil (r = 0.53, p = 0.06), Colombia (r = 0.48, p = 0.10) and South Africa (r = 0.43, p = 0.14). Allozyme assessment showed P. maximinoi to be polymorphic for 22 of the 25 loci analyzed with an average of 2.86 alleles per polymorphic locus. There was also evidence of inbreeding in the P. maximinoi populations. Provenances selected in trials for good volume production were generally the most genetically diverse based on biochemical and molecular marker assessment. Because of this relationship and the socio-economic needs of local people, in situ conservation programs for P. maximinoi in Mesoamerica should be based on securing the gene resources of populations that performed the best in well-replicated, international field trials. Pinus maximinoi has grown much faster than P. taeda in field trials established subtropical areas of Brazil through 14 years of age. Its juvenile wood properties are as good as or better than P. taeda. Specifically, its juvenile wood has a lower latewood percentage than found for the southern pines in the region, resulting in greater wood uniformity and stability. Hybrid crosses between P. taeda and P. maximinoi appear to be successful. The presentation discusses the opportunities of using P. maximinoi either as a pure species or as a hybrid with P. taeda in subtropical regions of South America. Sound conservation efforts now will ensure that breeding material is available in the future."],

Pitch canker disease has been identified in the southeastern United States, as well as in California, Mexico, Japan and South Africa. The disease is episodic in nature and can reach epidemic proportions with potentially devastating consequences for both managed and natural forests. Symptoms of pitch canker disease include discolored lesions (cankers) on stems and branches that generate profuse amounts of resin (pitch). Infected shoots eventually desiccate due to reduced water transport caused by pathogen development in vascular tissues. As with most diseases of pine, pitch canker disease is not well understood with respect to mechanisms of fungal pathogenicity, disease development, and disease resistance. To gain insight into the processes associated with disease development, we used a method called differential display of messenger RNA. This method was coupled with gene expression array analysis to identify genes from the pine host and from the fungal pathogen that are regulated differently during the disease state compared to the freeliving states of host and pathogen. The functions of these genes appear to be associated with plant defense and desiccation, however many genes of unknown function were also identified. The next goal of these studies is to identify genes that are associated with resistance, and to compare and contrast the gene expression programs that are associated with resistance vs. susceptibility. The large-scale screening of loblolly pine clones for resistance to pitch canker disease, which was carried out as part of the ADEPT project (Allele Discovery of Economically-important Pine Traits), is a major step toward this goal. Analysis of the screening study data revealed that resistance was heritable on the clone mean basis. A mixed linear model was used to predict genotypes that are highly resistant or highly susceptible to pitch canker disease. Ultimately it is hoped that association genetics approaches - such as those utilized in the ADEPT project - will identify host genes and alleles that condition pitch canker disease resistance. The genes identified by differential display serve as candidate genes for evaluating this approach."],

These important factors, which significantly affect the ground temperature results accuracy either are neglected or are simplified in Baggs' method.

Calculation results of two methods are both compared to the 3-14 years of measurement results at the 6 sites and validation results are discussed and investigated. Results demonstrate the Xing and Spitler's method averaged root mean square error (RMSE) is 2.2°C of the 6 sites; Baggs' method averaged RMSE is 3.4°C of the 6 sites.

The effective borehole thermal conductivity and the effective borehole thermal resistance are the two main parameters determined with the test, in addition, the undisturbed temperature of the borehole is determined, most often by measuring the temperature of the collector fluid during circulation before startup of the test. The undisturbed temperature of the borehole can also be determined from the vertical temperature profile in the borehole. Such temperature profiles are easily obtained with manual measurements using a probe in one of the collector pipes. In addition to an accurate measurement of the undisturbed temperature, the vertical temperature profile can be interpreted to find e.g. water bearing fractures, thermal pollution from nearby buildings and variations in geology. Temperature profile measurements after the TRT is performed can be used as an indicator of groundwater flow in the borehole that might affect the results from the response test and the performance of the borehole (Liebel 2012).",
        "This paper presents data from temperature profile measurements performed in single boreholes and in borehole fields in Norway. The profiles are measured before (undisturbed temperature) and after TRTs on boreholes ranging between 50 to 500 m. Based on the data, cases where the temperature profiles have been used to indicate variations in geology, water bearing fractures and variations in temperatures within neighboring boreholes are presented. Together with thermal conductivity values from laboratory measurements on rock samples, the profiles are also used to explain the results from TRTs affected by groundwater flow. Temperature profile measurements from several boreholes within single borehole fields also show significant differences important for the design of the GSHP system. As a conclusion, it is shown that the regular measurement of temperature profiles is an easy and cost effective method to gain knowledge and insight beyond that of a standard response test. It is therefore recommended to measure the undisturbed temperature profile of all boreholes in a GSHP as a regular part of the documentation and as a basis for design of GSHP systems."],

      abstract: ["Quality assurance is a very important aspect in the planning, implementation and operation of borehole heat exchangers (BHE). Within the research project Quality Assurance for Borehole Heat Exchangers (QEWS) the hydraulic sealing behaviour of industrial grouting materials was investigated. Important aspects therein were the capability for sealing between different aquifers and aging resistance against freeze-thaw cycle stress. For this purpose, a large-scale test rig for determining the hydraulic conductivity of borehole heat exchanger systems (BHES) was developed and put into operation. Compared to samples of the pure grouting material, the system samples exhibited significantly increased permeability, which was further increased by freeze-thaw cycle stress. It could be shown that the first freeze-thaw cycle caused the most significant aging effect. Aging caused by further freeze-thaw cycles could be partly compensated by regeneration effects. But the large-scale test rig has a substantial disadvantage: due to the length of the system sample, depending on the hydraulic permeability of the grouting material, the experimental program is very complex and time-consuming. Therefore, a downscaled test rig will be developed within the current project Quality Assurance for Borehole Heat Exchangers II (QEWS II)."],

      abstract: ["Ground source heat pumps (GSHP) are used to provide both heating and cooling to a given system. These heat pumps transfer heat efficiently between the system and the ground. Despite this high efficiency, there has been a low adoption rate for GSHPs owing to limited usage in commercial structures and buildings primarily due to high installation costs, but also due to a lack of drilling space and unbalanced heating/cooling loads. Phase change materials (PCMs) can absorb, store and release large amounts of latent heat over a defined narrow temperature range while the material changes phase or state. The main goal of this paper is to be able to predict numerically the performance of a single borehole with the effect of implementing PCMs. In order to successfully proceed with the discussion, two main objectives for this paper are presented. The first objective is to establish a finite element model of a single borehole with accurate assumptions in order to achieve an accurate prediction over four years of operation for a GSHP. Then, the second objective of the paper is to investigate the effect of using PCM in the borehole of GSHP to help maintain a more stable ground temperature range. Two scenarios of different PCM volumes and melting temperatures are presented. It was found that the performance enhancement due to PCMs reaches up to 35% in monthly average COP. In addition, PCMs show great potential to smooth the ground thermal response."],

The assumption, however, is not physically correct, which hinders the attainable accuracy. By using matched asymptotic expansion techniques, analytical models for the thermal response of geothermal heat exchangers are derived, which do not require the aforementioned simplification.

The use of tunnels is one of the measures to promote the HGHEs because the tunnel walls are suitable for laying the HGHEs. In this research, analysis of operation data and numerical modeling were carried out in a GSHP system using Slinky-coil HGHEs installed in the basement of a railway tunnel in Tokyo. Through the interpretation of operation data, the stable energy efficiency of the system was confirmed, though the amount of heat disposal and extraction were not well-balanced in the GSHP system. A numerical simulation model of the HGHE was then developed based on the physical properties of ground and the design of the HGHEs. The simulation model was well-validated with the operation data and showed that 1) the GSHP system could maintain the initial heating and cooling capacity for 10 years and 2) the deeper installation of the HGHE is favorable to obtain higher COP."],

      abstract: ["In Ontario, Canada, the building thermal energy market is largely driven by the low cost of natural gas as a heating fuel source, with natural gas rates being approximately five times less per unit energy than electricity. The hybridization of geo-exchange with conventional building energy systems is a well-established means of optimizing the economics of geo-exchange and accelerating the adoption of this technology as a standard building thermal energy system. Demand-side management (DSM) is a mechanism which can be utilized in Ontario's electricity market (or others with similar demand charge structures) to manipulate a user's overall electricity cost. This case study presents the results of a project currently under development in Ontario for a hybrid geo-exchange system, comprised of an in-house Ground-Source Heat-Pump (GSHP) supplemented by a hot/chilled water district energy system. Utilizing the GSHP as a flexible load, the heat-pump is deactivated during the electrical grid's peak periods, shifting the building's demand to the district system. Transferring the load to the district results in a reduction in the high-rise building's contribution to the electrical grid's peak power demand, and consequently a reduction in the building's blended annual electricity rate. This case study illustrates the potential to reduce a high-rise building's blended annual electricity rate by up to 52%, impacting both the building's plug load and geo-exchange operating costs, proportionally. The simulated results indicate a potential geo-heating and geo-cooling operational cost savings of 14% and 67%, respectively."],

Energy efficiency ratio (EER), coefficient of performance (COP), net annual value (NAV) and the average temperature rise (TEM) in soil of GSHP system are chosen as response factors to evaluate the system performance.

The result showed that the design outlet temperature of heat pump unit is the most important parameter for EER and COP, of which the contribution of significance are 41.88% and 88.12% respectively.

The result shows that it is possible to retrieve around 93 GWh/year of stored heat winter time, with the use of heat pumps using ammoniac as refrigerant.

An alternative to Energy Piles is to use wall substructures - so called diaphragm or screen walls - with embedded pipes that are partly below ground and partly exposed to basement spaces. This paper will describe the development of a model of such a heat exchanger that uses a weighting factor approach known as Dynamic Thermal Networks (DTN). This approach allows for detailed representation of the wall section geometry and multiple boundary conditions. In this case thermal boundary conditions are applied at surfaces representing the adjacent ground and the semiexposed basement wall surface in addition to the pipe surface. The weighting factors for the model have been derived using a parametric numerical model that has been developed using the OpenFOAM library. Validation of the model has been carried out using data from an extended series of thermal response test (TRT) measurements at a full-scale diaphragm wall heat exchanger in Barcelona. In this paper, development of the model using the DTN approach will be briefly described along with the parametric numerical modelling approach used to derive the weighting factor data. Validation test procedures will be presented along with comparisons between the predicted and measured fluid temperatures and heat transfer rates. Given some uncertainty in the experimental thermal properties, the model was able to predict the dynamics of thermal response over a range of operating conditions with reasonable accuracy and using very modest computational resources."],

This LABS is intended to generate reference Thermal Response Functions (TRFs) as well as to be a validation tool for borehole heat transfer models. The objective of this design process is to determine suitable geometrical and physical parameters for the LABS. An analytical scaling analysis is first performed and important scaling constraints are derived. In particular, it is shown that the downscaling process leads to significantly higher values for Neumann and convective boundary conditions whereas the Fourier number is invariant. A numerical model is then used to verify the scaling laws, determine the size of the LABS, as well as to evaluate the influence of top surface convection and borehole radius on generated TRFs. An adequate shape for the LABS is found to be a quarter cylinder of radius and height 1.0 m, weighing around 1.2 tonnes. Natural convection on the top boundary proves to have a significant effect on the generated TRF with deviations of at least 15%. This convection effect is proposed as an explanation for the difference observed between experimental and analytical results in Cimmino and Bernier (2015). A numerical reproduction of their test leads to a relative difference of 1.1% at the last reported time. As small borehole radii are challenging to reproduce in a LABS, the effect of the borehole radius on TRFs is investigated. It is found that Eskilson's radius correction (1987) is not fully satisfactory and a new correction method must be undertaken."],

They are appealing because they are easy to use, compact and computationally efficient. However, analytical formulations also cut down the complexity of the conditions in the field by limited resolution of variations in space and time, and by often simplified specifications of boundary conditions. In this presentation, we focus on the definition of the land surface boundary condition in line source solutions. As BHEs are thin elongated forms that can be approximated by a linear shape function, main attention is on the radial heat transfer, but less on the axial effects. Given the long operation time, however, the sharp physical boundary at the top may exert a substantial influence on the temperature evolution in the shallow ground and thus influence the performance of the ground source heat pump. We examine different formulations with Dirichlet and Cauchy type boundaries included in the line source equation, with and without horizontal groundwater flow. Both homogeneous as well as inhomogeneous implementations are presented, which offer new flexibilities for simulation of nonuniform land surface impacts such as associated with varying land use types. The presented approach also facilitates to account for the accelerated ground heat flux due to global warming and due to urbanization such as observed in so-called subsurface urban heat islands in many cities."],

A web-based free-to-use tool is being developed for quick techno-economic analysis of GSHP applications in nearly any building in the United States. This tool is enabled by improvements in the calculation methodology to allow rapid sizing of borehole configurations that provide significant cost savings. The screening tool currently uses US Department of Energy (DOE) prototype building models and an extended g-function library to size ground heat exchangers and simulate the performance of GSHP systems. The team is integrating with DOE's Oak Ridge National Laboratory's AutoBEM program to automatically create a building model based on user inputs. This paper introduces the structure, components, features, and results of the web-based screening tool for GSHP applications. Future directions for further developing the tool are also discussed."],

The present work addresses this issue by presenting the experimental validation of non-stationary convolutions for predicting the thermal response of a ground heat exchanger to both transient heat loads and advection. First, the method is outlined along with a simple demonstration case emulating the time-variation of groundwater velocity. Then, it is validated against experimental data retrieved from a 35-day multi-flow rate thermal response test conducted on a real standing column well. The results show a mean absolute error of 0.28 °C between the experimental and simulated results, which represents good accuracy considering the complexity of the thermo-hydro-processes at work. The high computing efficiency of the proposed technique is also demonstrated and suggests its potential for future implementation in common-use design tools."],

Nevertheless, as in other open-loop wells, they can be affected by clogging processes if detrimental hydrogeological conditions are present locally. This problem is relatively rare and still difficult to anticipate, even though some specific factors have been reported, such as substratum mineralogy and groundwater quality. This study proposes the use of a column experiments and coupon cell to anticipate clogging at two different sites near Montreal, Canada. The experiments were performed for duration of 50 and 52 d using thermoregulated columns at four temperatures. The results identified a difference in the chemistry of each site without any significant clogging risk. Site A showed a decrease in carbonates, magnesium, and calcium ions, and scanning electron microscopy showed a minor tendency to form carbonate deposits. Sulfate and calcium dissolution of the bedrock material were observed at Site B. Scanning electron microscopy of the coupons revealed organic matter with high carbon and sulfate concentrations. The same type of deposits was observed at Site B after three years of operation. In conclusion, these tests helped identify various potential clogging phenomena and indicated that both sites are not susceptible to major clogging risks."],

Optimal predictive controllers such as Model Predictive Control (MPC) are desired for these complex systems due to their optimized and automated energy savings potential (while providing the same or better thermal comfort) thanks to system integration and their anticipative action. However, the predictions of these controllers are typically limited to a few days. Consequently, the controller is unaware whether abusive energy injection/extraction into/from the soil will deplete the source over the years. This paper investigates in which cases the long-term dynamics of the borefield ought to be included in the MPC formulation. A simulation model of a hybrid GEOTABS system is constructed. Different borefield sizes, ground imbalance loads, and electricity/gas ratios are evaluated. The model control inputs are optimized to minimize the energy use in 5 years through (i) a reference Optimal Control Problem (OCP) for the 5 years, solved in hourly timesteps and (ii) an MPC control with a prediction horizon of 1 week. The obtained results reveal that MPC can be up to 20% far from the true optimal, especially in the cases where the borefield is undersized and there is a large cost gap between the different energy systems."],

In this study, we investigated two models accounting for the ground surface temperature change; both models are based on the Stacked Finite Line Source (SFLS) model. The first model treats the ground surface as a set of rectangles, each with its own temperature; the second model treats the ground as an infinite surface with imposed temperature. The first model is more accurate, as it allows to consider different temperatures for different surfaces. However, the second model requires less computational time and is easier to implement. Therefore, we investigated whether the latter model can provide a good approximation of the former. Our results suggest that the second model can often provide a good approximation with significantly less computational time, especially for larger built areas; however, it could be unacceptably inaccurate for smaller neighbourhoods. We also investigated a strategy to improve its accuracy without compromising its computational speed; the strategy seems promising but requires more investigation."],

Eight linear and non-linear ML models were employed and the results show that the linear models namely, multiple linear regression (MLR), elastic net (ELN) and support vector regression (SVR) can predict the power consumption with a very high level of accuracy. Within the linear models, the coefficient of variation of the root mean squared error (CV-RMSE) for the MLR was 4.04062 which was 0.19% and 0.05% less than the ELN and SVR model respectively. Within the five non-linear models, gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) exhibited the lowest CV-RMSE i.e. 4.26141 (which is 5.46% higher than the MLR model). The CV-RMSE for extreme gradient boosting trees (XGBT) was the highest (i.e. 45.42% higher than the MLR model).

Results show that the new configuration requires a 22% shorter borehole by using the thermal energy storage, and reduces the annual peak electricity demand by almost 500kW cumulatively by using the battery energy storage.

As individual systems, GSHP and PVT systems have experienced sluggish market penetration; GSHP systems have relatively high capital cost compared to conventional heating and cooling systems, while PVT systems have niche applications mainly limited to swimming pool heating in moderate to cold climates. Coupled together, the design of the holistic system is non-unique; the ground heat exchanger (GHX) could be designed to optimize efficiency of the PV cells, or the PVT array could be designed for thermal management of annual ground thermal load imbalances on the ground heat exchanger (GHX), or some combination of these design approaches. Given the non-unique design approach for these coupled systems, this study examined various design, control, and operating strategies through hourly simulation software (TRNSYS) for a 20-year life cycle of the system of an actual zero-energy building in a moderately cold climate, which is quite cooling-dominated owing to its superior envelope design. The PVT design and control strategies were aimed at reducing the size of the GHX versus improving the electrical production of the PV. The investigated control strategies found that it is possible to reduce the size of the GHX by 40%, and increase PV electrical energy production by 5%. The control strategy of using nocturnal cooling by the PVT to unload stored thermal energy from the GHX achieved the lowest life-cycle cost. The nocturnal monthly cooling energy unloaded varied between 30 and 140 kWh/m2 for summer and winter months over the 20 years of simulation period."],

The heating operation data clearly showed the improved COP of the heat pump when the groundwater is pumped. To evaluate the effect of groundwater pumping, we then collected the water pumping data from the groundwater snow-melting system in Akita City, Japan and input those data to the existing field-scale numerical groundwater flow and heat transport model of the area. The model was run to calculate the groundwater velocity and temperature in the area under the influence of groundwater pumping. Then, the output from the model was used for developing another numerical model, small-scale GHE model, which can estimate the minimum necessary GHE length for a Japanese standard detached house at several locations in the area. The GHE length data were mapped using GIS software to generate the GSHP potential map under the influence of groundwater pumping. The comparison between the potential maps with and without groundwater pumping clearly indicated the contribution of water pumping in reducing the GHE length and the initial cost of GSHP systems."],

GSHPs take advantage of relatively constant ground temperatures as a medium for heat exchange, in contrast to the use of highly variable air temperatures. Conventional systems use a heat pump paired with a borehole heat exchanger to exchange heat with the ground. Widespread use of these systems has been impeded by high initial costs and low short-term return on investment. Helical steel piles (HSP) are structural elements that are drilled into the soil to provide support to buildings. With only minor modifications, these structures have shown promise as a viable alternative to the use of the conventional borehole heat exchanger. At present, there is little understanding of the functionality and the optimal design of HSPs as heat exchangers under different soil properties such as heterogeneity, porosity and saturation content. Therefore, the focus of this paper is to investigate the performance of HSPs under different heterogeneous soil conditions using numerical analysis.

GHPs utilize the ground as a heat source to warm buildings more efficiently than other space-heating systems. The coupling with the ground offers seasonal thermal storage so that GHPs can also cool buildings in summer more efficiently than other space-cooling systems. This study simulated the performance of GHP systems for various commercial and residential buildings in 15 climate zones in the United States. Combined with the latest End-Use Load Profiles of the US building stock and grid modeling, this study aims to assess the impacts of a national deployment of GHP systems on the US electric grid in terms of energy consumption, emissions, and operational resilience. The preliminary results show that the GHP deployment can save 429 billion kWh of electricity (a 19% reduction from baseline) and reduce carbon emissions by 496 million tons per year (a 31 % reduction from baseline). A geographical view of the results indicates that retrofitting existing HVAC systems with new GHP systems can lead to further reductions in annual electricity consumption and peak electricity demand in the southern regions of the United States than in other parts of the country. On the other hand, GHP retrofits result in higher percentages of site energy savings and carbon emission reduction in the north (cold climates) than in the south (warm climates)."],

Recent advances show that the short-term g-functions can also be retrieved by a deconvolution algorithm. However, the known deconvolution algorithm is only validated for a set of operating parameters and duration of less than 10 days. A first objective of this article is to demonstrate that longer g-functions can be retrieved with such an algorithm. Then, a second objective is to extend the application of the deconvolution to consider time varying operating parameters throughout a ground heat exchanger's operation. To achieve those objectives, the deconvolution will be first applied to various numerical year-long simulations of a ground source heat pump system with stationary conditions. Then, an extended multi-signal deconvolution will be applied to a non-stationary thermal response test of 30 days. Both tests show adequate temperature reconstruction with RMSE of less than 0.05 °C and 0.2 °C for the first and second scenarios respectively."],

In the first part of the paper, a physics-based model of a water-to-water heat pump is briefly presented. This model is incorporated in TRNSYS simulations using a performance map where variable speed operation is handled through a linear relationship linking the COP to the percentage of the full capacity being used. The ground heat exchanger is modeled using a thermal resistance and capacitance approach to account for borehole thermal capacity. Simulations are performed on a typical residential building located in a cold climate (Montreal, Canada) and equipped with either a fixed or variable speed ground-source heat pump. Results are obtained for eight cases with: variable or fixed speed operation (VSC or FSC), with or without consideration of borehole thermal capacity (TC or NTC), and with annual heating needs covered at 90% or 100% by the heat pump. The differences in the required borehole length between the TC and NTC cases are relatively small. The smallest required borehole length is for the FSC-90%-TC case (180 m) and the longest is for the VSC-100%-TC case (250 m). The VSC-100% case has the largest seasonal Performance factor (SPF) at 4.14 and the FSC-90% case has the lowest at 3.11."],

The sandbox experiment is built up to validate the the RF model. Based on the experiment, this case is also studied by the numerical simulation and the RF model. Results show that the soil temperature differences between the RF model and the experiment are only -0.21°C ~0.69°C at the 96th time step. The relative errors of the soil temperatures between RF model and numerical simulation at the 1800th time step are only 1.86%~3.94%. RF model consumes 30% time of the numerical simulation for the soil temperature calculation with 1800 time steps and consumes only 1% time of the numerical simulation for that with 350400 time steps.

A modified direct shear apparatus has been developed to investigate the interface behavior between soil and pile. Then, based on the experiment results, the thermo-mechanical behavior of PGHE with spiral coils was investigated by a 3-D simulation model. The thermal loads induce additional compressive stress when the temperature rise, and the local compressive stress can reach to 9.35MPa near the heat exchanger pipe. Additionally, heat extraction led to a decrease of friction angle and normal contact pressure at the interface between soil and pile, and as a consequence, the shear force decreases with the temperature drop.

Artificially pre-cooling a system's bore-field during an off-peak operating bracket allows for improved thermal characteristics for the following peak period. With improved bore-field thermal characteristics during peak periods, cooling mode operation can be exploited more efficiently, resulting in a reduction in peak power consumption and operating costs. This study presents a preliminary evaluation of the impact the proposed off-peak ground pre-cool strategy has on the operation of a HGSHP system, simulated for a mid-rise multi-residential facility located in Toronto, Canada. Two analyses are presented simulating the strategy's impact as a function of pre-cool duration and hybrid system proportions.

Finally, the different control strategies that have been developed, implemented and experimentally tested in the system will be described. These strategies' focus is not in optimizing the performance of each individual component, but in optimizing the energy performance of the system working as a whole, while keeping the user comfort.

The intent of the installation was to observe and monitor the system over a 10-year period in order to develop a better understanding of the performance of GSHPs in ground with permafrost and to help inform future design. The system enjoyed one season of better-than-expected performance, averaging a COP of 3.7its first winter.

This paper contributes by studying the thermo-mechanical behavior of the precast piles which are 15-meter long and have a quadratic cross section and a W-shape pipe heat exchanger. This article aims to numerically assess the additional changes in the pile load transfer generated by its heating and cooling. In addressing this objective, a preliminary multi-physical finite element analysis is conducted which serves as a tool for exploring: i) the thermally induced mechanical stresses within the concrete and on the pile-soil axial and shaft resistances; ii) the maximum upward/downward displacements. A one-year time span is considered under operational and extreme thermal boundary conditions. The results show that a typical geothermal utilization of the energy foundation does not generate significant structural implications on the geotechnical capacity of a single energy pile. However, ground thermal loads need to be considered in the design phase to account for potential extreme temperature changes, which could generate thermal stresses that equalize the mechanically generated ones."],

      abstract: ["Pile foundations provide a low-intrusive mechanism for installing heat exchangers into the ground, especially if the piles are being installed to support the building. The ground temperature is relatively constant at depths >10 m, providing consistent performance of the heat exchanger to the operator. However, as these piles are also being used to support the building above, a greater understanding of clay's response to temperature must be further identified to allow confidence in their installation. A review of case studies, field tests and laboratory tests illustrates the need for further work in ths area. This paper reports initial results from a series of specialized tests on two types of clay subjected to five thermal cycles, representing the long-term operation of pile foundation heat exchangers, and shows that distinct shrink/swell cycles occur leading to ~5% reduction in volume over the five cycles for a kaolin clay and 0.5% for a glacial till.."],

In this paper, a coupled thermo-hydro-geochemical model simulating the operation of a standing column well is used to illustrate the link between the temperature and the reaction rate of calcite. The results demonstrate that bleeding only 10% of the pumped water allows to get rid of calcium ions in solution in the well and reduces substantially the precipitated calcite mass. Our simulations clearly indicate that groundwater flow induced by the bleed mainly occurs in the fracture since significant chemical variations are observed downstream of the fracture.

When the heating and cooling loads are extremely unbalanced, ground temperature can slowly migrate up or down in the long term, diminishing the GSHP system's performance, and eventually causing the system to fail. This failure occurs when the ground can no longer accept or provide more heat for a building. Therefore, a method to mitigate thermal imbalance is needed. Previous studies in the literature examine the effects of borehole configurations in geo-exchange. However, no study has been done to analyze the effects of varying borehole lengths in a bore field. The objective of this study is to examine the effects on thermal performance from changing the length of individual boreholes while retaining the same total borehole length. In this paper, the four centre boreholes in a 4x4 borehole system were shortened and the length of the remaining boreholes was recalculated to meet the total required ground loop length. A 20 year operation was simulated for a school building model with centre borehole lengths of 100 m, 80 m, and 50 m and separation distances of 3 m, 4 m, and 6 m, to study the benefits of shortening the centre boreholes. The results demonstrate that by adjusting the length of the centre boreholes, separation can be reduced."],

By adopting GHE zoning operation, the energy consumption of the GSHP system is found to be reduced compared with that of a GHE operated without zoning. Operation without zoning shows that the GHE summer outlet water temperature increases faster than that with zoning operation and power demands are increased for the given GSHP load.

Effects of fluid temperature and viscosity on head losses, borehole thermal resistance and heat pump operation are reviewed. Efficiency curves for currently available circulators are proposed. Annual energy simulations are then performed on a residential GCHP system. Energy consumption (pump and heat pump) is evaluated subhourly based on fluid temperature and properties prevailing during each time step. Results show, as expected, that higher mixture concentrations and higher flow rates lead to higher energy consumption. Methanol with a concentration of 15% and a 1.5 gpm/ton flow rate provides the best energy performances while ethanol at 30% with 3 gpm/ton is the worst choice, requiring 16% more energy and 525% more pumping power than for the methanol case. Laminar flow in boreholes appears to be favorable when compared to turbulent flow which leads to relatively high pumping energy consumption.

      abstract: ["In a conventional thermal response test (TRT), the main parameter evaluated is the bulk subsurface thermal conductivity surrounding the borehole. It is also possible to evaluate the borehole thermal resistance. Several approaches were proposed in the literature to evaluate the possible combination of these two parameters. For example, it is often suggested to measure the temperature during the injection and the recovery periods, where the thermal conductivity is found with the recovery response whereas the borehole resistance is calculated with injection measurements. For this calculation, some authors suggested to use different means for the borehole temperature considering the asymmetric temperature distribution along the pipe legs that affects the borehole resistance. Some confusion about the borehole resistance that should be obtained may come from the difference between the 2D borehole resistance and the effective (3D) borehole resistance taking into account the internal heat transfer between the pipe legs inside the borehole. In practice, the latter one should be used in a design algorithm since it provides a more representative approach. In many cases, the difference between the two is rather small. However, since the borehole length is becoming an important variable to optimize, this difference in borehole resistance may represent a factor to better assess in the design of future systems. This effective resistance depends on the 2D borehole resistance, the water flow rate, the length of the borehole and the so called \"internal resistance.\" To our knowledge, the in-situ assessment of this internal resistance has never been achieved. In this paper, we present our first investigation of a method that can be used to evaluate both the 2D borehole resistance (Rb) and the 2D internal resistance (Ra). The method uses the temperature at the bottom of the borehole at the same time as the inlet and outlet temperatures that are measured in a conventional TRT. Interesting results were found by comparison with theoretical resistances calculated with the multipole method"],

In previous works, a single U borehole heat exchanger (BHE) dynamic model, called Borehole-to-Ground (B2G), was developed and experimentally validated. The B2G model is based on the thermal network approach, combined with a vertical discretization of the borehole. However, the thermal properties of the surrounding ground were modelled as an average, constant with depth. For homogeneous type of soils, this assumption might be acceptable but, when considering heterogeneous type of soils, modelling the presence of different layers with different materials could provide more accurate results.

Experimental data corresponding to a Thermal Response Test (TRT) performed in a real BHE existing at the Universitat Politècnica\r\nde València, were used to validate this new feature of the B2G model.

During the test the carrier-fluid exchanges a constant heat flux with the ground while circulating in a pilot Borehole Heat Exchanger (BHE). During a Distributed Thermal Response Test (DTRT) the ground thermal conductivity and borehole thermal resistance are determined at different vertical sections along the borehole. The measured fluid temperature values are analysed with numerical or analytical approaches based on mathematical models which typically approximate the BHE. Those models are based on some strict assumptions, including pure conduction and constant heat transfer rate. During a heat extraction TRT the operating conditions to the ground are similar to the \"winter mode\" conditions of a working BHE system. In such case the estimated thermal behaviour of the borehole can differ from the result obtained by means of a heat injection TRT. This issue is of peculiar interest for water-filled boreholes, where the BHE thermal resistance is related to the water temperature and density gradient in the borehole filling-space. In this operating mode a heat pump is usually employed and the constant heat transfer rate condition required by the models can be difficult to be respected since the efficiency of the cooling-machine is dependent on the inlet carrier-fluid temperature to the evaporator. In this paper a methodology to perform a heat extraction DTRT with constant heat transfer rate to the ground is presented. The approach described has been applied in a real water-filled borehole installed in Stockholm, Sweden. Data analysis results are presented and the outcomes regarding the evaluation of the local borehole thermal resistance are discussed and compared with those from an erlier heat injection test performed in the same borehole."],

Results showed that the double U-pipe with thermally enhanced pipes was the best option for the conditions considered in the study. Depending on the configuration, the use of TE pipes instead of standard HDPE pipes allowed a reduction of the GHE length between 9 and 14.8% and a reduction of the construction cost between 3.3 and 8.6 %. For each configuration tested, the operation costs were similar between the GHEs equipped with HDPE and TE pipes. This study demonstrates that GHEs equipped with TE pipes can be a financially viable and environmentally beneficial solution, especially if secondary benefits are factored in such as saved footprints on available real estate."],

Generally, the borehole thermal resistance is considered as steady-state; however, when considering the borefield hourly response to the building variable thermal loads, also the transient behavior of the grout thermal resistance plays an important role, which is quite often neglected. This study analyzes, with a dimensionless approach, the transient grout thermal resistance, with particular attention devoted to the effect of the boundary condition imposed to the internal tubes, namely imposed heat flux, imposed temperature and imposed convective coefficient, the last being the real operating conditions. In addition, the effects of grout to ground thermophysical properties and of shank spacing are analysed. The steady state numerical results are also compared with literature correlations. Finally, numerical evidences are given to demonstrate that the usual approach of calculating the overall BHE resistance just summing the grout resistance, numerical obtained by imposing a temperature on the tube surface, to the convective one can lead to meaningful errors at low Biot numbers."],

The presented method is based on a well-known solution to an analogous problem in the field of well hydraulics. This solution method, known mathematically as an incomplete Bessel function, and known in the field of well hydraulics as the 'leaky aquifer function', describes the hydraulic head distribution in an aquifer with predominantly radial flow to a well combined with vertical 'leakage' from geologic layers above and below the pumped aquifer. The solution is adapted to model heat transfer from an array of arbitrarily-placed vertical boreholes of finite depth. With proper expression of parameters in the incomplete Bessel function, we show that g-functions of previous researchers can be approximated. The proposed method has been implemented into Matlab and Excel/VBA for g-function generation and monthly GHX simulation."],

In that case, zones of microslip exist over at least part of the wrap, possibly including the entry region.",

However, forward integration is necessary if the web is not elastic, or the heat transfer is affected by the tension or the amount of slip.",

Practically, this may lead to difficulties in controlling tension or speed. The model also allows the cross-web direction stress to be estimated. In a region of heating, this often becomes compressive, and can be compared with a critical value for buckling. Exceeding this level would lead to wrinkle formation in the hot, soft web, usually a serious quality problem. The model can therefore be used to explore process design and conditions to reduce the likelihood of wrinkling and improve the ability to control tension and speed."],

The model discretizes the web into smaller segments of equal width, each having a constant web thickness within a segment. Tension is assigned to each segment using Hakiel's approach [2]; the tension is updated after the winding of each lap based on the deformed radius of the segment relative to the relaxed radius profile of that lap. In each segment, a 2D winding model is applied. The pseudo 3D model is capable of dealing with (1) a varying thickness profile in both CMD (cross machine direction) and MD (machine direction); (2) winding tension variation with the winding laps; and (3) varying core stiffness in the CMD. Moreover, with the consideration of viscoelastic behavior in the web the effects of winding conditions, such as winding speed and tension, on the wound roll stress can be determined. The model is especially suitable for viscoelastic materials with relatively short characteristic relaxation times, such as plastic webs with glass transition temperature close to room temperature. Numerical methods were used to determine the stress distributions in the wound roll. The pseudo 3D viscoelastic winding model was validated by comparing results on the dimensional changes of a web in three situations. They include (1) the formation of cambered web (in-plane imperfection) due to linearly varying thickness; and (2) the formation of localized baggy lanes due to an edge burr following slitting; and (3) the formation of baggy web (out-of-plane imperfection) due to increased web thickness in the middle of the web.

        "This paper proposes guidelines for allowable in-plane roller misalignment, the more critical of the two directions, based on well-tested wrinkling and web break models. The wrinkling criteria is lack of wrinkles crossing a roller at any value of tension. The web break criteria is limiting maximum tension (at the outside of the bend) to twice the average and thus keep the inside of the bend from going into compression. For those who do not wish to use models, an experimental technique to obtained allowable in-plane misalignment is also described. For those who do not wish to use either models or experiment, a set of quality classes is described that captures best practices in some of the more common web applications.",
        "This paper also includes a few parametric studies revolving around some of the more common materials such as paper and thin films that will show what sensitivities are important and what might be safely ignored. All of this is aimed at what should be done, i.e., when should a roller be moved. Finally, a brief review of alignment methods and tools describe what we could do in a commercial setting. In other words how close can we expect roller alignment to get when we choose to move a roller."],

Webs can enter a cylindrical roller normally if the forces required to sustain normal entry and do not exceed the available friction forces. Webs with simple non-uniform length variation across their width (camber) will steer toward the long side, affecting the steady state lateral deformation and hence registration. Most previous studies have focused on tests and modeling a cambered web span in a free span between two rollers. Often these studies assume some displacement and slope boundary conditions are known and seek the remaining condition(s) that would dictate the steady state lateral deformation of the cambered web in the free span. In many spans in a process machine there may be no known boundary conditions and no steady state deformation of the cambered web. The web may travel toward the long side continually from one web span until the next until a web guide attempts to return the web to an acceptable lateral location in the process machine. The simplest case of multiple span cambered web lateral behavior is that of a cambered web belt transiting two aligned rollers which is the focus of the current work.

Whenever the entry angle becomes non-zero, a web that is moving longitudinally through a process will also move laterally on the roller in a direction that returns the entry angle to zero. If the web is modeled as a perfectly flexible string, this behavior is intuitively obvious because it bends sharply on entering a roller that is pivoted or shifted laterally. However, in the case of the most commonly used Euler-Bernoulli (E-B) beam model, the web can't make a sharp bend. If it is initially perpendicular to the roller axis, beam theory says that, provided there is no slipping, it should remain perpendicular as the roller is shifted or pivoted and thus wouldn't move. We know from experience, however, that a real moving web begins to move laterally soon after a roller pivots or shifts? So, how can this be?"],

        "This paper deals with a new measurement technique that is able to observe the process of building up nip-induced tension in the outer layers of a roll. With the use of digital image processing, this method ensures the registration of the two-dimensional displacement field of the outer layers with fairly high precision. Based on the first principal of the equations of mechanics, it is possible to derive the stress and strain in the layers from the displacement field. Thus, it succeeds to calculate the tangential stress in the outer layers of a roll taking the compression as well as the slippage of the layers into account.",
        "In all experimental test series the tangential stress increases within the first 4 to 15 layers to a maximum value. Afterwards, there is still a considerable displacement of the layers relative to the core, but the layer-to-layer slippage is so small that the change in strain is negligible. Furthermore, it is shown that there is a reduced increase of nip-induced tension in the first approximate 50 layers near the core. Comparing the nip-induced displacement of different type of papers, there are clearly differences noticeable concerning the amount of displacement, as well as the rapidness of increase to the final displacement."],

A combination of material, web handling and process technology developments has continued to expand the range of film structures that can be produced. This has enabled polypropylene to cost effectively replace competing materials in many applications. Other than those companies with a pure low-cost producer strategy, BOPP manufacturers must introduce new products and extend their product ranges in order to maintain or increase their competitive positions. As new markets are identified, product line extensions commonly involve the introduction of new technology (eg for the development of very thick films). At the same time as diversifying the product range, even those suppliers with a differentiated product strategy must identify ways to contain or reduce manufacturing costs, while also increasing manufacturing flexibility.",
        "In order to continue to accomplish these conflicting goals, further developments are needed in web handling and film making technologies. Specifically our ability to quickly, easily and accurately model equipment performance and film-equipment interactions must be extended. The range of requirements is broadened as film manufactures produce more complex film structures and strive to increase overall equipment performance (line speeds, uptime, waste reduction etc) across a diversifying product range, and customers process BOPP using many more downstream technologies (metallizing, printing, sheeting, guillotining etc).",

Hakiel's nonlinear model with air entrainment effects is applied to analyze in-roll stress distributions in the radial and tangential directions. It is well known experimentally that a decrease in the wind-up tension prevents star defects due to negative tangential stress under winding. Thus, in the present optimization method, wind-up tension is gradually decreased in the radial direction to minimize the tangential stresses under the constraint of nonnegative tangential stresses. At the same time, we consider the friction conditions to prevent the slippage between web layers due to a decrease of radial stresses and friction force. Successive quadratic programming, which is the typical mathematical programming method, is used as the optimization technique. Wind-up tension is expressed by the third-order spline curve of a radial coordinate. The linear function with respect to the radial coordinate is used as the original wind-up tension. The optimized wind-up tensions are obtained for various winding condition, and we confirmed theoretically and experimentally that the in-roll stress distributions were very much improved for preventing wrinkle and slippage by optimization method proposed."],

Papers in this volume address a number of issues including rapid deterioration of bobwhite quail habitat, effects of disease, effects of environmental toxicants , harvest patterns, effects of land management practices , and other quail management techniques. There are those who believe that no more bobwhite quail research is needed because we already know all we need to know about bobwhite quail management. However, as some of the symposium papers point out, our information is not current. Studies conducted 20 or 30 years ago apply only to conditions of 20 or 30 years ago.

      abstract: ["Prairie chickens and sharptailed grouse evolved and have survived in the grasslands of the central portions of the North American continent . The vegetation, fire, drought, extremes in temperature, native grazing species, and the prairie grouse coexisted in a dynamic system that was only minimally influenced by humans. The prairie grouse in general may have benefited by early agricultural activities of the more permanent settlers in the late 1800's and early 1900's. However, the grouse of today are providing a record of the changes in land use that affect not only the grouse but a flora and fauna that biologists refer to as the grassland ecosystem. This symposium focuses on only a few species of prairie birds with the purpose of providing a written record of the current status of these indicators of the grassland ecosystem. The 1st 5 papers in these proceedings were invited. The remaining papers were volunteered by biologists working with research and management of the prairie grouse. The planning for the symposium began with the impetus of the Oklahoma Cooperative Wildlife Research Unit and the \"blessing\" of the Prairie Grouse Technical Council meeting in Pierre, South Dakota in Sept. 1977. Notices of the symposium were provided to all known prairie grouse biologists and other interested persons. All authors provided \"camera ready\" copy to reduce publication costs. Not all current or immediate past research on prairie grouse is represented in this proceedings. It is hoped that studies and information not represented here will be published soon in other literature available to those interested in prairie grouse and the grassland ecosystem. We desire that the information contained on these pages will reach those decision makers , including landowners and or land operators, who can favorably influence the future of the prairie grouse and their grasslands support base."],

However, process induced defects often limit wider usage of LCM in structural applications. Thorough knowledge of these defects, as well as their formation mechanisms and prevention techniques, is essential in developing improved LCM processes. In this article, process induced defects in liquid molding processes of composites, categorized into preform, flow induced and cure induced defects, are reviewed. Preform defects are further presented as fiber misalignment and fiber undulation (waviness and wrinkling). The respective causes, detrimental effects, and possible prevention methods of these defects are presented. Thereafter, flow induced defects are classified as voids and dry spots. Dry spot formation mechanisms in LCM processes and available prevention techniques are summarized. In addition, void formation mechanisms, adverse effects on composite properties, and removal techniques are presented. Cure induced defects include microcracks, void growth and geometrical distortions (warpage and spring-in). Each of these defects are discussed along with their underlying causes as well as their control and reduction schemes.</jats:p>"],

Given the increased use of randomized trials and their influence on medicine, one method to combat research waste is to conduct RCTs only when a systematic review (SR) suggests more data are needed or when no previous systematic reviews are identified. Here, we hypothesize SRs would be rarely cited as justification for conducting RCTs.",
        "Methods: We analysed RCTs published between 2016 and 2018 in New England Journal of Medicine, Lancet, and Journal of the American Medical Association. We performed duplicate and independent data extraction to ensure the accuracy and validity of our data. For each trial, we extracted whether SRs were cited as justification for conducting the clinical trial.",
        "Results: Our search retrieved 665 records, of which 628 were included. Overall, 706 SR's were cited in these 628 RCTs; of which, 318 were referenced in the introduction, 82 in the methods, and 306 in the discussion. 49 SRs were cited verbatim as justification for conducting the trial. RCTs published in Lancet were more likely to cite a SR as justification for conducting the trial.",
        "Conclusion: Very few clinical trials cite systematic reviews as the basis for undertaking the trial. We believe trialists should be required to present relevant systematic reviews to an ethics or peer review committee demonstrating an unmet need prior to initiating a trial. Eliminating research waste is both a scientific and ethical responsibility."],

In the early 1990s MMA entered the United States as the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). Both the internet and social media have advanced the popularity of MMA and have increased the public's exposure to fighting injuries. Here we examine injuries from popular UFC bouts and observe whether the volume of Google searches for specific injuries increases after the associated fights.",
        "Study Design: Our sample of injuries was gathered from \"Sherdog's Top 10 Worst UFC Injuries\" available from www.sherdog.com. Injury information, the injured fighter's name, date of injury, and the popularity of the fighter (measured by number of Twitter followers) were gathered from Google Trends searches.",

Measurements of water intake (WI, ml/day), urine volume (UV, ml/day), and urine sodium excretion (UNaE, μEq/day) were recorded daily in the baseline and ten-day post-implantation periods in three groups of mice: vehicle-placebo (V-P), AngII-placebo (AngII-P), and AngII-E2 (n=4/group).

Unfortunately, patients tend to seek diagnostic testing late, when more severe symptoms exist, indicating advanced disease with severe fibrosis. There is a gap in knowledge about the immunologic process of HCV-induced fibrosis and cirrhosis development. Interleukin-33 (IL-33) is a cytokine implicated in various inflammatory and fibrotic diseases. We hypothesize that IL-33 plays a role in the pathogenesis of HCV, particularly in fibrosis and cirrhosis development leading to malignant transformation and thus may serve as an inflammatory biomarker. We studied livers from normal subjects - no liver-related diagnoses (n=6), subjects with HCV-cirrhosis (n=7), and subjects with HCV/HCC (n=7). We performed immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded liver tissue sections using a human IL-33 antibody and DAB staining system. To quantify our results, we performed image analyses quantifying IL-33 chromogen stain using an algorithm to calculate the signal strength of an image to determine the amount of antibody-specific chromogen per pixel, expressed in energy units per pixel (eu/px). We found that IL-33 is normally expressed in human hepatocytes; it is expressed at higher levels in HCV-cirrhosis patients and at lower levels in HCV-HCC patients. We plan to expand this study by including more patients in the future."],

DSC is the most commonly used thermal analysis technique due to its ease of operation and rapid analysis. Furthermore, it provides precise, reproducible heat flow measurements.1 Thermal sensitivity testing determines the potential hazards of energetic materials when exposed to increasing levels of heat. Heat capacity measurements are particularly relevant when mixing, drying, transferring, and/or storing energetic materials.1 Two of the most commonly used explosives are PETN and RDX. PETN, or pentaerythritol tetranitrate, is a high explosive that is used in military detonating cord and blasting caps.2 RDX, or cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine, is used extensively in military munitions.3 As a means to increase the validity of thermal sensitivity testing, proficiency tests can be performed to improve protocols and standardization. The Explosive Testing Users Group, organized by Safety Management Services, Inc., developed a Round Robin testing project, and selected thermal analysis of PETN and RDX. For this research, a TA Instruments, Inc. SDT 650 was used to test the thermal sensitivity of the explosive standards. This work demonstrates the DSC proficiency testing performed at the CENFEX Fire and Explosives Research Laboratory. Results from the laboratory were compared to federal, national, and international laboratories participating in the Round Robin testing project. Statistical analyses demonstrated similarities among participating laboratories and identified potential protocol and standardization improvements."],

Most clinicians and researchers believe more work can still be done to improve the diagnosis and treatment process. Advancements have occurred in injury definition and impact recognition, thus the diagnosis, treatment, and recovery processes need to match. The SCAT5, a standardized tool for evaluating concussions designed for use by physicians and healthcare professionals, is utilized for baseline testing and diagnosis. This study aimed to determine a normative dataset from the results of the SCAT5 performed on non-injured college-aged individuals. 26 participants (13 male and 13 female) completed the cross-sectional study. Data was collected via the SCAT5 questionnaire. Subjects were inquired to monitor their orientation, memorization, and concentration via the SCAT5 a valid and reliable measure currently utilized by healthcare providers. In addition to the orientation, memorization and concentration components, participants also completed the balance testing section which was the BESS test. Data from this study provides baseline comparative data on non-athlete college-aged individuals. This data can be utilized by clinicians in the concussion diagnosis and return to play decisions. Further research with an increased population is needed to find greater correlations between variables and a more robust set of comparative results."],

        "Background: In vertebrates, cranial arteries supply structures of the head, and branches from the abdominal aorta supply the viscera. Although human vasculature is well known, details of vasculature are unknown for most vertebrates, especially extinct ones. We investigate arteries in the extinct dinosaur Tyrannosaurus rex using its extant archosaur relatives (birds and crocodilians), with the aim of understanding how vessels contributed to this dinosaur's extreme size and functional adaptations. This study is the first to infer abdominal vasculature in an extinct organism.",
        "Methods: We inferred arteries in Tyrannosaurus with extant phylogenetic bracketing (EPB), which assesses unknown traits in an organism based on its position in a phylogenetic tree between relatives with known features. EPB is useful for inferring traits (i.e. soft tissue) that do not fossilize well. We examined the abdominal and cranial arteries of predatory and non-predatory birds (modern dinosaurs), crocodilians (their nearest relatives), and humans through literature sources and dissections. Humans represent the distantly-related outgroup to archosaurs; arteries present in all three groups strengthens their inference for Tyrannosaurus.",
        "Results: Abdominal Arteries: In all four vertebrates the large abdominal aorta bifurcates distally into the right and left common iliac arteries, and archosaurs possess a large caudal artery supplying the tail. The coeliac trunk from the aorta has left gastric, splenic, and common hepatic; birds lack splenic and common hepatic arteries with the gastric artery anastomosing with the coeliac trunk, whereas crocodilians have a gastric artery that branches into the gastro-hepatico-intestinal artery and pancreo-intestinal artery. These arteries supply foregut structures. Branches of the superior mesenteric artery supplies the midgut and inferior mesenteric artery the hindgut. Crocodilians only possess one mesenteric artery, which supplies the entire intestinal tract. Humans have paired middle suprarenal arteries and renal arteries. Archosaurs lack middle suprarenal arteries, but have renal arteries that supply both the adrenal glands and kidneys. All vertebrates have paired gonadal arteries.",
        "Cranial Arteries: In all vertebrates, vertebral arteries supply the brain, and the common carotid bifurcates into external and internal carotids. The external carotid supplies structures of the neck and head external to the cranium, branching into the superior thyroid, ascending pharyngeal, lingual, facial, occipital, posterior auricular, maxillary, and superficial temporal arteries. Archosaurs' external carotid branches into temporomandibular, pterygoid, maxillomandibular, palatomaxillary, maxillary, palatine, and oromandibular arteries. The internal carotid artery supplies the brain, eyes, and forehead. In humans, the internal carotid artery branches into the anterior cerebral, middle cerebral, posterior communicating, and ophthalmic arteries, whereas archosaurs' internal carotid artery branches into the cerebral carotid, common encephalic, stapedial, temporoorbital, and caudal auricular arteries.",
        "Inferences for Tyrannosaurus: As an archosaur, we can confidently infer that Tyrannosaurus possessed temporoorbital, rostral auricular, cerebral carotid, mandibular, palatomaxillary, oromandibular, palatine, medial nasal, common nasal, and opthalmotemporal arteries. Birds and crocodilians differ is some cephalic and abdominal arteries, and their inference in Tyrannosaurus will require a search for shared osteological correlates for these vessels."],

The bioassay was performed by dissolving the compounds in dimethyl sulfoxide and impregnating filter paper disks which were placed onto Mueller Hinton agar plates spread inoculated in a standardized manner to obtain even cell lawns after incubation for 18±1 hours at 37°C. Zones of growth inhibition were measured with the aid of electronic calipers.",
        "RESULTS: Five strains of Staphylococcus aureus, plus Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus epidermidis were all found to be susceptible to the hydrophobic derivative EIPE-1, while other gram-positive and all gram-negative organisms exhibited resistant phenotypes at potencies tested. The more polar EIPE-HCl derivative failed to inhibit growth of any of the organisms examined, regardless of gram reactivity.",
        "CONCLUSION: Hydrophobic EIPE derivative EIPE-1 clearly possesses a gram-positive antibacterial spectrum, although only certain organisms are susceptible at the potencies employed for this study. The susceptibility of two methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (SFL 8 and SFL 64) to EIPE-1 suggests that its mechanism of action does not involve the penicillin-binding proteins of peptidoglycan biosynthesis targeted by mainstream B-lactam antibiotics. The uniform resistance of 13 phylogenetically disparate gram-negative bacteria supports the notion that intrinsic outer membrane exclusion properties may play a role in the mechanism underlying their phenotypic resistance to the molecule. The more polar EIPE-HCl possesses no antibacterial properties at the potencies examined here. Future work will include performing minimal inhibitory concentration bioassays to quantitatively describe susceptibly in selected gram-positive bacteria. In addition, batch culture growth kinetics assays will be crucial to learning the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for susceptibility and resistance to EIPE-1."],

As future physicians practicing evidence-based medicine, it is crucial that physicians in training are able to both interpret and produce quality research. Currently, the long-term impact of active research participation is unknown in this population. In this study, we aim to (1) explore research activity as measured by peer-reviewed publications among family medicine residency graduates and (2) determine if an association exists between publication rates before, during, or after family medicine residency.",

      abstract: ["Obesity is a multifaceted disease that poses a health care challenge, affecting ~40% of adults in the United States. It is associated with a range of co-morbidities and exorbitant medical costs. Obesity as a disease disproportionately affects different ethnic groups, as well as individuals of different socioeconomic status. However, the disparity between sexes is particularly concerning. 45% of women are obese compared to only 38% in men. Given this disparity, there is still surprisingly little literature on female obesity, even in animal models. It is known that ovarian hormones influence body weight, and that ovariectomized (OVX) rats rapidly gain weight. Additionally, it was noted in our previous study that this post-OVX weight gain is associated with regionally specific changes in neuroimmune signals in the CNS, particularly in areas involved in body weight regulation and feeding control, such as the arcuate nucleus (ARC), paraventricular nucleus (PVN), and the dorsal vagal complex (DVC). Obesity management is an issue as well. Due to its multifaceted nature, obesity is difficult to control. The most common recommendations for obese individuals are still dieting and exercise. In this study, we investigated the impact of exercise on weight gain along with the associated changes in neuroimmune signals focusing on Interleukin-6 (IL6), Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein (MCP-1), Toll-like Receptor 4 (TLR4), and Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) due to their involvement in innate immune activation, which is associated with obesity.",
        "Sixteen female adult Sprague-Dawley rats were OVX, with 8 then housed in cages with running wheels attached, while the other 8 were housed in standard cages without access to running wheels. Body weight and running distance were recorded weekly. At the 3-week mark, the rats were switched, with rats that initially were sedentary housed in cages with running wheels, and rats that had immediate access to running wheels transferred to standard cages. Rats were sacrificed at the end of the 6th week, and plasma, brains and spleens were collected. Punches were taken from ARC, PVN, and DVC and the expression of IL6, MCP-1, GFAP, and TLR4 were quantified using immunoblotting (IL-6, MCP) or ELISA kits (GFAP, TLR4).",
        "OVX rats gained significantly less weight during their first week of running, regardless of whether they ran immediately or 3 weeks after OVX. Both TLR4 and GFAP in the DVC were significantly greater in the immediate exercise group, whereas IL-6 and MCP showed no differences between the two groups. Thus, exercise had transient effects to slow post-OVX weight gain, but was more effective when it was delayed for 3 weeks. With regard to neuroimmune signals, the effects of exercise were limited to GFAP and TLR4 and were regionally specific. Together, these findings suggest that exercise and the concomitant slowing of the post-OVX weight gain may reduce innate immune activation in hindbrain areas that respond to stimuli associated with feeding."],

A 57-year-old presented to the emergency department with acute on chronic abdominal pain, worsening abdominal distention and decreased appetite. Abdominal imaging revealed the presence of a multi-septated cystic right adnexal mass concerning for metastatic ovarian carcinoma. Intra-operatively the diagnosis of a likely chronic ruptured appendix at the base of the colon was confirmed. In postmenopausal women the majority of adnexal masses are benign neoplasms, however, the risk of malignancy is much greater than in premenopausal women. Postmenopausal women with clinical symptoms and findings on diagnostic imaging suggestive of malignancy warrant expedited management. While imaging and biomarkers help to give insight into origin of masses and can aid in determining treatment, diagnostic operations may be ultimately required to achieve final diagnosis and direct further management.",
        "Methods: All data collected was de identified and kept within a secure location.",
        "Results: Adnexal masses can present in a variety of ways and yield pathology from simple cysts to infectious process or even metastatic carcinoma. On the contrary, the diagnosis of acute appendicitis is typically straight forward, classically manifesting with acute periumbilical pain localizing to the right lower quadrant, abdominal guarding, and leukocytosis. The atypical presentation of chronic appendicitis can often lead to misdiagnosis, particularly in sexually active females, or as in our case, patients presenting with symptoms consistent with an ovarian malignancy.",
        "Conclusions: Chronic appendicitis (CA) is a rare clinical entity with an incidence of 1.5% in all cases of chronic abdominal pain of unknown etiology. CA poses as a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma for clinicians since a majority of patients present with atypical symptoms. It is very rarely thought to be the primary diagnosis due to the low frequency of occurrence. A postmenopausal patient with chronic worsening abdominal pain, distention, and decreased appetite presenting with a complex adnexal mass and ascites is highly suspicious for ovarian malignancy. It is imperative to thoroughly review all images and consider subsequent imaging modalities to ensure infectious etiologies are excluded, but ultimately, diagnostic operations may be inevitable."],

This data will be used to determine whether optimal antibiotic therapy was prescribed upon hospital discharge. Optimal therapy is defined as: prescription in accordance with nationally-approved guidelines for the management of CAP and UTI; effective and narrowest spectrum of activity; correct dose for indication, organ dysfunction, and medication allergies; and correct duration of therapy. This study will also the assess antibiotic classes most frequently involved in errors, as well as the most commonly occurring types of errors (incorrect drug, dose, or duration). Patients with multiple types of infection will be excluded from the study. Data collected will be organized and evaluated using REDCapTM.

While matched obstetrics and gynecology residents only averaged slightly more research experiences than the average resident, publications throughout obstetrics and gynecology training trended upward as training progressed. The highest average of publications was seen post- residency, which suggests there may be an opportunity for residents to increase their scholastic activity while in training. We propose that one way to increase the scholarly activity while in training is to encourage collaborative research involvement between medical students, residents, and attending physicians. This joint effort will not only increase resident scholarly activity but will also facilitate teaching research principles to medical students early in medical training and provide opportunities for networking and knowledge sharing."],

Improvements in measures of aerobic capacity (such as VO2max) are crucial for individuals whom seek to be physically active for longer periods of time.

The main outcomes of interest were either pre-post testing assessments of aerobic fitness (such as VO2max or VO2peak) and/or pre-post testing assessments of aerobic performance (such as time to exhaustion).",

However, the impact of these metabolic changes imparted by integrase strand transfer inhibitor based regimens in particular remains unclear. The objective of this study is to evaluate weight change in treatment-naive patients with newly initiated ART in a Ryan White Clinic.",
        "Methods: This IRB-approved, retrospective chart review study utilized EMR records to identify patients aged 18 years or older with a diagnosis of HIV-1, who are treatment-naive or have been without ART for >6 months, initiated on ART between January 1, 2013 and January 1, 2018, maintained therapy for  ≥24 months, had weight values recorded at least twice during the study period, and were initiated on any three-drug NNRTI, INSTI, or PI-based regimen. The following data was collected, recorded without patient identifiers, and maintained confidentially: patient regimen, age, gender, ethnicity, AIDS status, plasma HIV-1 RNA (viral load), CD4+ T-cell count, weight, BMI, and BMI categories. Patient weight, BMI, and BMI categories were evaluated at baseline, 6 months, and 18 months on ART.",
        "Results: Of the 3,054 patients identified, a total of 200 patients were included in the final analysis. The patient population consisted primarily of Caucasian (55.0%) males (81.0%) with an average age of 38.3 years. At initiation of treatment, the median CD4+ T-cell count = 356.2 cells/uL, HIV-1 RNA viral load = 481,801 copies/mL, weight = 80.8 kg, and BMI = 26.2 kg/m2. For all classes evaluated, the highest percentage of patients at baseline fell within BMI category indicating normal weight (18.5-24.9 kg/m2). A total of 42 (21.0%), 50 (25.0%), and 113 (56.5%) patients were initiated on NNRTI, PI, and INSTI-based regimens, respectively. Of the 113 patients who were initiated on an INSTI-based regimen, 82 (72.5%) patients began regimens containing doultegravir, 25 (22.1%) patients began regimens containing elvitegravir, and 6 (5.3%) patients began regimens containing raltegravir. All 6 patients who were initiated on raltegravir were also on concomitant darunavir. At 18 months of therapy, a median increase in weight of 2.2 kg and BMI of 0.5 kg/m2 was associated with NNRTI-based regimens, compared to a 3.9 kg and 1.3 kg/m2 increase associated with PI-based regimens. Of the INSTI-based regimens, use of dolutegravir was associated with a 4.3 kg and 1.7 kg/m2 increase, elvitegravir a 1.1 kg and 0.4 kg/m2 increase, and raltegravir a 7.7 kg and 2.5 kg/m2 increase in weight and BMI, respectively.

        "Methods: We included the testimonies of all public speakers at the PADAC meetings from November 2009 to May 2019 using verbatim transcripts deposited on the FDA website. We used a pilot tested Google form to perform blinded, independent data extraction for each speaker. An ordered logistic regression was performed with each speaker's overall statement about the drug — negative, positive or neutral — serving as the dependent variable. Independent variables included whether the speaker was taking the drug in question, whether the speaker had the disorder treated by the drug, and whether the speaker disclosed a FCOI.

Our ordered logistic regression model found that speakers who disclosed a FCOI were significantly more likely to give a positive testimony than those who did not (OR = 5.13, 95% CI = 1.83—14.37, P < 0.001) and that speakers who had the disorder for which the drug was taken were significantly more likely to provide positive testimony than speakers who did not have the disorder (OR=5.49, 95% CI = 1.84 — 14.37, P < .01).",

However, these findings combined with others show a consistent effect. Greater efforts are needed to understand the effects of public speakers on voting behaviors. Changes to the current guidance on FDA FCOI disclosure are needed, and the future role of public speakers should be questioned."],

Frameworks included for application are intersectionality theory, historical trauma and decolonization, human rights, constructivist self-development theory, the posttraumatic growth paradigm, and adverse childhood experiences. This discussion will help to illuminate the dynamics of IPV that are actionable by practitioners using frameworks that promote cultural sensitivity, inclusion, and strengths-based practice with diverse populations. The authors discuss the scope of IPV while focusing on critical vulnerable people and exploring issues of relative privilege and oppression.

Inasmuch as shales had already been studied, identified, classified and characterized in a previous study (1972), the main objective of the present investigation was to determine the type and amounts of stabilizing agents to yield optimum conditions in upgrading the shales for highway construction purposes. Eight Oklahoma shales representing regional characteristics but differing texturally and mineralogically were selected on the basis of the 1972 study. Of the various stabilizing agents used, it was found that 6 percent hydrated lime, 14 percent portland cement, and 25 percent flyash give imptimum conditions by imparting acceptable strength levels to the shales. The degree of strength attained varies inversely with the plasticity of shale. On the basis of compressive strength, cyclic loading, and weatherability criteria, cement is the most effective additive, flyash the least and lime moderately effective. Combinations of the three stabilizing agents show that shales can be upgraded strength-wise when the three main stabilizing agents are used conjunctively; in fact, the data suggest that such uses are more economical and mor promising. The addition of small amounts (less than 2 percent) of NaC1, CaC1 2, NaOH, and Na2CO3 to the shales which already have been mixed with one of the main stabilizing agents, further enhances the stabilization benefication."],

      abstract: ["When a bridge is designed, conservative assumptions are made with regard to load distribution and structural continuity. Simple support is assumed when rotational restraint exists, deck girders are assumed noncomposite when significant shear transfer occurs at service loads, haunch is ignored, and elements such as railing are treated as nonstructural dead load rather than as stiffening elements. As a result of these and other conservative assumptions, stresses calculated for design may be well above stresses computed on the basis of strains measured while the bridge is in service. The magnitude of the stress fluctuations under service load determines the fatigue life of the bridge. The accuracy of remaining fatigue life estimates can be improved if these estimates can be based on measured rather than computed strains, typically resulting in a significant increase in projected bridge life. A more accurate fatigue life estimate leads to fewer negative fatigue life computations for operating, undamaged bridges. The result is an overall reduction in retrofit and replacement costs.' To take advantage of this cost savings, a data acquisition system has been constructed for use by the Oklahoma Department of Transportation in measuring strains on in-service bridges. Construction of the system involved the development of hardware and software to facilitate interaction with a general-purpose commercial datalogger. Application of the system requires the user to install strain gages on the structure of interest, extend leadwires from the gages to a junction box containing bridge completion circuitry, connect the junction box to a battery-powered datalogger, and connect the datalogger to an on-site computer. The computer is loaded with software to assist the user in setting up the datalogger and downloading collected data. This report contains information regarding construction of the data acquisition system which may be useful for system maintenance and operation. This report also contains a set of general guidelines for conducting a bridge test and applying the test results. It is recommended that a complete bridge evaluation include a thorough visual inspection, an analysis of the structure, and a load test. The load test should include both a series of short-term tests in which stresses are recorded as a truck of known weight passes over the bridge, and at least one long-term test in which the number and magnitude of stress cycles are recorded under normal traffic. Data collected using the data acquisition system can be used to estimate remaining fatigue life and set inspection intervals. The recommended procedure for estimating remaining fatigue life follows NCHRP Report 299, taking full advantage of the fact that stresses are measured rather than computed. The procedure for setting inspection intervals is based on a fracture mechanics estimate of the time required for a crack of an assumed initial length to grow to a critical length when driven by the measured stress cycles."],

To stabilize it, Portland cement, fly ash, lime and their conjunctive use were deemed necessary. Prior to field implementation, laboratory studies were conducted which showed that stabilization reduced the plasticity index substantially. The general amelioration of the shale subgrade is reflected in strength improvement after wet-dry cycles and the upgrading of the shear strength parameters of cohesion and angle of internal friction. The strength of short beams was correlated to unconfined compressive strength. The employment of the flexural and compressive moduli of elasticity is presented as an example of assessing pavement strength versus stresses induced by traffic. Data from X-ray diffractograms asvertain that the activity of the clay minerals in the raw shale is reduced as new crystals of hydrated and unhydrated calcium alumina and calcium silicates are formed. In addition, SEM observations depict these crystals and show that the void area is reduced thus rendering a more densified fabric."],

This report presents outcomes from an extensive statewide examination of vehicle misclassification at Oklahoma Department of Transportation (ODOT) AVC stations employing the PEEK Traffic 'FHWA-USA' classification algorithm. A ground truth system utilizing continuous video recordings was developed and utilized. Results from the rigorous investigation are reported herein. Also detailed in this report is a novel method for an improved classification algorithm designed to reduce the number of classification errors. Thirteen Gaussian distributions were employed to model axle spacing for each of the 13 FHWA vehicle types. Classifications obtained from video recordings and PEEK Traffic axle spacing measurements for a sample of 20,000 vehicles were recorded and analyzed to obtain 13 good-fit Gaussian distributions that correspond with each vehicle class. An optimization algorithm was then implemented to develop axle spacing thresholds for vehicles currently traveling Oklahoma's highways and to minimize vehicle misclassification. The new scheme was then implemented in the PEEK Traffic automatic data record equipment and experimentally evaluated for accuracy. Results demonstrated its effectiveness in improving vehicle classifications and reducing persistent overall system errors characteristic of the 'FHWA-USA' Scheme.

One important objective of this long-term study is to develop a correlation between the index properties of geogrids and their field performance for base reinforcement applications. The index properties that will be studied include the junction strength, low-strain rib strength (i.e. strength at 2%-strain and 5%-strain) and the ultimate rib strength of selected geogrids. The project will involve the selection of a full-depth roadway construction project authorized by ODOT. During the construction of the road subgrade, one test section will be used to examine and compare the performance of selected base course reinforcement geogrid products. The field performance of different geogrids will be monitored using different instruments and monitoring techniques and compared with one another as a function of their index properties. Selected instruments include Earth Pressure Cells (EPC) to measure the stress on the subgrade underneath the geogrid, pore pressure transducers to measure the pore pressure in the subgrade and strain gauges to measure the tensile strength of the different geoshyntetics. The results of this study will help ODOT to develop an improved and expanded set of materials specification guidelines for the use of geogrids in aggregate base reinforcement applications. The outcome of this study will help ODOT and other transportation agencies in the U.S. develop more durable and economical aggregate base designs which will result in longer service life and reduced maintenance costs for the roadways in Oklahoma and across the United States."],

Post-construction densification was found in each of the asphalt bound layers at the sites and occurred at both wheelpath and non-wheelpath locations. Increases of up to 12 percent in percent density values of the surface course were observed. Both heave and subsidence of surface elevation points were observed.

The performance of silanes on bridge decks was completed on 60 bridges that were in service between 5 to 20 years. Samples were taken from the travel lane and the shoulder. The work found that after 12 years that 100% of the silane applications were effective. By 15 years then only 68% were still effective and between 17 to 20 years then only 16% were still effective. The investigations suggest that abrasion was not a major deterioration mechanism; instead, deterioration from the high alkaline pore solution is suggested to be of importance. This work goes on to investigate a two part system of silane and epoxy sealer, a silane, and then a control sample and their resistance to chloride penetration. Both sealers show improved performance over the sample with just concrete. Additionally, a new experimental technique is presented that is capable of non-destructively imaging the penetration of external fluids into paste and mortar. This test is rapid, accurate, and can be used for in-situ testing. This test method again shows that the silane investigated was effective at reducing the ingress of ions."],

      abstract: ["Shear capacity of real-world prestressed concrete girders designed in the 1960’s and 1970’s is a concern because AASHTO Standard Specifications (AASHTO-STD) employed the quarter-point rule for shear design, which is less conservative for shear demands than today's AASHTO LRFD. Shear tests were conducted on two full sized AASHTO Type II girders, one of which had been in service for nearly forty years before being replaced due to irreparable damage. The comparison of nominal shear capacities according to the 11th Edition AASHTO-STD (1973), AASHTO LRFD (2004), ACI 318-08 including provisions for strut and tie models is carried out. By examining the ratios of nominal shear capacity to demands for each code, considering all load and resistance factors, these code-to-code comparisons are better able to identify girders that may be deficient according to today's standards than a direct comparison of nominal capacities alone. Experimental results for shear capacity of real-world girders are compared with the codes' nominal capacities to check if the girders' are structurally sufficient. Additionally, LRFR is used to check the statistical safety for AASHTO inventory and legal loads. Preliminary results are presented on the estimation of effective prestressing force using static test data. Nominal shear capacity is particularly sensitive to effective prestressing force under current design codes, so it's important to have accurate values when making calculations. In attempt to get more accurate results for effective prestressing force, span varying flexural stiffness is assumed. This assumption reflects that girders with long histories may be damaged, obvious or otherwise. Inverse problems are formulated where input and output are measured to determine system properties. Key challenges are discussed, and future work is identified. For a given girder, the ratio of nominal shear capacity to demands has generally decreased with newer codes. Girders having this ratio near one for the 11th Edition AASHTO-STD may be structurally deficient according to newer codes, however, LRFR results show that the girders in this study are safe for all AASHTO legal loads. Experimental results indicate that the girders’ actual capacity exceeds nominal capacity of current codes. Additional shear capacity t ests should be performed on more real-world girders to get a more definitive conclusion."],

This report describes studies which were pointed toward developing an understanding of several of these. A study of making an asphaltic concrete conductive was accomplished using coke breeze mixed with asphalt and aggregate. Mixes containing 45% coke breeze, 7-11% asphalt and the remainder a standard aggregate were found to be appropriate for conductive layers for cathodic protection. It was found possible to determine corrosion rates electrochemically using linear polarization. This laboratory technique gave corrosion rates similar to values obtained in other laboratories using other techniques. Testing in the laboratory and bridge decks of molybdneum-molybdneum oxide electrodes indicated these would be useful as embeddable reference electrodes in concrete. Silver-silver chloride electrodes were not found to be stable in this application. These electrochemical half-cells, Mo /MoO should prove to be useful for cathodic protection systems which require controlled potentials. Reinforced concrete cylinders were exposed to cathodic protection level currents for five years. Pullout strengths and concentrations of sodium, potassium and chloride ions were determined throughout this time period. These data indicate the cathodic protection currents reduce the bond strength of the steel and concrete after about 3.5 years, due to accumulation of sodium and potassium at the interface between steel and concrete."],

To meet these objectives, a research plan consisting of literature review, statistical experimental design, field sampling, and laboratory testing was adopted. Random sampling was conducted both at the production plant and the roadway independent of acceptance and job control sampling. Testing was perfonned in the materials laboratories of the different ODOT Divisions. ANOV A results indicated that sampling and testing variances represent a significant portion of the total observed variance in the measured quality attributes of bituminous concrete pavement construction. The computed percentages within QNQC specification tolerances indicated that the present tolerances are practical and defensible. Correlations between density measurements obtained from the nuclear gauge and core samples ranged from 0.49 to 0.84. The use of calibrated relationships though regression analysis improved the estimation of core densities from nuclear measurements. Variability due to sampling and testing was largerin the core method than the nuclear gauge method. The correlation coefficient between individual asphalt content measurements using the extraction method and the nuclear gauge method was 0.63. No significant difference was found between the average asphalt content obtained from the extraction method and the average asphalt content obtained using the nuclear gauge method.

FANW ALL Noise Barrier Walls are erected from precast, reinforced, concrete panels. On I R-240-1(338)000, the panels were cast at Reinforced Earth's Waco, Texas plant and shipped to the project site by truck.. The major advantage of FANW ALL over Cast in Place Noise Barrier was expected to be lower overall cost. Although the purchase price per square foot is higher for FANW ALL than the contract price per square foot for Cast in Place Wall, it was thought that lower labor costs for erecting the wall would bring the overall price of FANW ALL below that of the the Cast in Place type. On Project I R-240-1 (338), the expected labor reduction did not materialize, due to problems in fitting the panels together. Difficulties in fitting the panels were corrected. However, this was not done before the labor required (man-hours) had increased to the point where it was approximately equal to that for the same length of Cast in Place Wall. The completed Fanwall section will be monitored for settlement, lateral movement, and tilting."],

Recruiters use a variety of push and pull factors to separate potential recruits from their society while drawing them in to ISIS. Radicalization is especially prominent in Western Europe due to the host countries' failure to assist Muslims with integration into Western society. This paper examines why ISIS's recruitment has been successful by analyzing how each push and pull factor influences radicalization and makes the target susceptible to recruitment. In particular, this paper focuses on the importance of a sense of belonging and the ways in which all other listed factors relate to it. This paper also discusses shifts in the rhetoric of ISIS's propaganda and the effects that those shifts have had on recruitment. In addition, it analyzes a few case studies and argues that the effective usage of Western media will reduce the number of radicalized individuals.",

While numerous treaties incorporate the rights of forced migrants, the Refugee Convention with the 1967 Protocol represents the most important instrument in regards to refugee protection. The European Union (EU) has established its own regional refugee and human rights regime with the European Convention of Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union as centerpieces. Although the Court of Justice of the European Union and the European Court of Human Rights have applied more progressive interpretations of refugee and asylum law, they have at times defaulted to conservative rulings, thereby compromising refugee protection. EU legislation, specifically the CEAS with the Dublin Regulation, has qualified the access to asylum and the principle of non- refoulement. The restrictive European visa regime and the various control mechanisms limit the right to seek asylum, the right to leave one's country, and access to an asylum procedure. The \"safe country\" concept further compromises refugee protection as it homogenizes asylum seekers and decreases the quality of asylum procedures. The EU is likely to continue and expand its conservative asylum system, which will come at the expense of overall refugee security and protection.",

The authors of this paper sought to analyze the most prominent of those policies, the Temporary Protection Regulation (TPR), specifically to understand the impact it has had on female refugees flowing into the country. Unfortunately, because Turkey did not adequately consider the needs particular to refugee women in crafting the TPR, Syrian women in the country are unduly vulnerable to gender based violence, lapses in appropriate healthcare, and sexual abuse. By recycling old domestic legislation and not effectively delimiting refugee policies, Turkey has many gaping holes in the protections they afford refugees. Building on past feminist policy analyses, this dissection of the TPR highlights the danger of ignoring gender in policy construction and shows the very real world consequences of \"gender-neutral\" policy.",

Before the war, water resources were managed poorly, which\r\nled to political unrest due to loss of livelihoods and urban migration.\r\nAgriculture in Iraq has been devastated due to reduced water flow and\r\npoor water management practices. Iraq receives roughly 98 percent of its\r\nwater resources from the Tigris-Euphrates Basin, and Iraq has seen its\r\nshare of river flow plummet in recent years. There exists no trilateral\r\nagreement between all riparian states dealing with the Euphrates. There\r\nhave been several bilateral agreements regulating flow, but these have\r\noften been ignored, or are impossible to enforce. The necessary measures\r\nneeded to create sustainable practices regarding the river cannot be taken\r\nwithout an enforceable trilateral agreement."],

      abstract: ["When French colonialists governed parts of Africa, they partitioned Africans into groups of unique, individual statuses: sujets, metis, originaires, tirailleurs, and assimiles. These statuses contributed to uneven access to French goods and services within the French Empire, and the effects of such privilege help to explain the variation in success in Francophone West Africa. Senegal, specifically, included four privileged cities known as the Four Communes. Daily life in these four cities - Saint-Louis, Goree, Rufisque, and Dakar - resembled Parisian life, in terms of both architecture and economic structure. The number of French settlers in the Communes increased access to education and administrative positions for Africans, primarily those belonging to the metis or originaires categories. This paper focuses on the lives of originaires, who were granted citizenship rights in the early twentieth century, attended French schools, and often worked for the French empire or as wealthy businessmen. Originaires gained the right to vote in 1833, although most other African groups did not gain this political right until 1946. This earlier access to political rights helped to establish the place of originaires and the Four Communes in the greater French Empire, which in turn led to a more active role in the French Union and better post-independence relationships. Furthermore, the success of these individuals contributed to Senegal's economic success in a post-colonial world.",

However, these documents failed to create a balance and only created tensions as minority Christian Maronites often had control over majority Sunni Muslims.

This article situates itself within the study of the Putin cult, taking a perspective based in generational theory that distinguishes millennials as a unique group, and seeks to examine the ways in which millennials in particular engage with the Putin cult. The Putin cult is not a uniquely millennial phenomenon and cults of personality have existed for ages. However, millennials engage with the Putin cult in an interesting and unique way due to the digital era within which they grew up and live, along with the spread of activist ideas into Russia. This examination uses qualitative methods and finds that millennials use tactics related to these peculiarities to engage with the Putin cult in a manner that is tongue-in-cheek, while preserving an image that would retain favorability with the Kremlin. This is of particular importance given the increasing spotlight on US-Russian relations as well as the presence of cyber-issues and the Putin cult within this subject.",

      abstract: ["Though the motivations for unrest were similar across Ukraine during the 2014 Euromaidan Revolution, the means of expressing unhappiness contrasted dramatically between eastern and western Ukraine. In the west of the country protests were centered in the nation's capital, Kiev, and barring a few violent outbursts, were generally peaceful. They consisted of demonstrations, the occupation of public spaces, and innovative uses of new information and communication technologies (ICTs). In the east, on the other hand, conditions were more violent. While these protesters did employ blockages and occupation as tools of their cause, they did so armed and with more aggressive intentions. After driving the previous government officials out of power, these groups took control of the local governments. Using the theories of political scientist Fox Piven and sociologist Richard Fields to analyze the case study of Ukraine, the author seeks in this essay to examine how and why the methods of collective action varied between eastern and western Ukraine during the 2014 Euromaidan Revolution and how these variations may have influenced the eventual outcomes of the each region.",

      abstract: ["The rise of Daesh took the world by surprise, as the group took advantage of discontented Sunni populations and political turmoil to rapidly expand in Iraq and Syria. The group, designated as a terror organization by the United States and the international community, grew out of a fusion between al Qaeda in Iraq and remnants of the deposed Ba'athist regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq. Although a coalition of domestic and international actors primarily led by the United States has recaptured much of the territory held by Daesh at its peak, the increasingly globalized nature of the group has ensured that its eradication remains a top priority of the international community. Efforts at eradication are complicated by the ongoing Syrian Civil War and the myriad interests at play, which have contributed to the group's enduring presence in the region. Nevertheless, there are still several policy options available to the international coalition supporting local groups like the Iraqi military, Kurdish fighters, and certain Syrian militants in the fight against Daesh. Air strikes, drone surveillance, and stricter border controls can be used to disrupt the group's revenue streams and supply chains. Closing national borders and collaborating with social media corporations to impede online recruitment can help slow the steady stream of foreign fighters flocking to the group in Iraq and Syria. Targeting Daesh leadership also degrades the ability of the group to maintain the infrastructural services it offers the populations under its control, as well as inhibiting the strategic capabilities of the group. Finally, arming, training, and providing logistical and intelligence support to local actors fighting against the group offers the hope of preventing a power vacuum and aiding the development of a consolidated government once Daesh territory is completely reclaimed. These policy proposals, many of which are already being implemented by elements of the international coalition against Daesh, will provide for the degradation and eventual eradication of the regime, while also enabling the local actors in the region to have an important stake in the outcome, which is critical for the prospects of a feasible government taking power once the dust from Daesh has settled.",

      abstract: ["The Turkish War of Independence and the following reforms\r\nimplemented by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk were watershed events in both\r\nIslamic and world history. The political and social climate of Turkey,\r\npreviously the Ottoman Empire, had long reflected the complex\r\nrelationships between the Muslim and Western worlds, especially the\r\npower struggle between politics and religion. When Atatürk initiated a\r\nrevolution in the country in 1919, politics, culture, and religion were\r\ndramatically and irrevocably changed. However, while the reforms\r\nthemselves were swift, the philosophical and ideological development\r\nbehind them was not. Religion and state in the Muslim world have\r\nevolved in tandem since Islam’s inception, and this relationship took a\r\nnew turn with the rise of modern political Islam in the nineteenth\r\ncentury. The goal of this paper is to show that, when considered from\r\nthe broader perspective of Islamic history, Atatürk’s creation and\r\nsecularization of the Republic of Turkey represented the culmination of\r\npolitical Islam and fulfilled the goals of the movement’s leaders, Jamal\r\nal-din al-Afghani and Mohammad Abduh."],

This research seeks to explain the causes of the Second Libyan Civil War through current theoretical understandings of civil war causes. This research is split into two broad sections: the first concerning the environment in which the Second Libyan Civil War could occur, and the second focused on the motivations that moved involved parties to war. It is found that Libya's state of anocracy, or general state weakness, was the environment that allowed the conflict to occur, and political grievances, particularly of the nation's Islamists, that motivated the involved parties to war. It also found that oil played an indirect role in the conflict, specifically warping the economy to promote militia membership as one of the few viable livelihoods available. These conclusions bear relevance to policymakers as it demonstrates that a strong state apparatus and political inclusion are key to the avoidance of future conflict in the country.",

Is it too small for me? I thought. How will I get along with people in this new culture? The wheels of my mind spun with hypothetical scenarios and notions of what French people might be like. These questions evoked an inexplicable feeling that led me to pack my things and move to rural France for four months. I wanted to discover a microcosm of European culture, gain an understanding of people who think differently and see the world through another lens.",
        "On the day of my arrival, my train sputtered into the station of Limoges some two hours late. It was getting dark outside and the welcoming team had already gone home. I was annoyed, tired and nervous. I tried to maintain my composure and suppress the feeling of dread rising up in me. I felt totally left to my own devices. After taking some time to put together a game plan, I hailed a taxi and left for my bed and breakfast. Upon arriving, I realized that not only was the door locked, but my host, Pascal, was nowhere in sight. I called to see where he was, but all I could gather from his rambling\r\non the phone was that he was angry, not home and upset by the quality of my French. I was offended by his coarseness and dumbfounded by his impoliteness. Although Pascal was well- intentioned, his brash attitude made me want nothing more than to catch the next flight back home."],

      abstract: ["In 1859, Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species\r\n(The Origin), outlining his theory of evolution through the\r\nmechanism of natural selection. With this text, he employed and\r\nshaped the genre of evolutionary epic, one of the most significant\r\nnarrative formats of the latter half of the nineteenth century.\r\nCharacterized by a progressive synthesis of scientific knowledge\r\ncovering vast sweeps of time and aimed at readers of variable class,\r\nprofession, and education, the evolutionary epic became a useful\r\ngenre for Victorian science writers and popularizers. In his\r\nconclusion to The Origin, Darwin laid the foundation of the debate\r\nover the narrative of evolutionary epic. The final lines of his text\r\nread:\r\n\"Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and\r\ndeath, the most exalted object which we are\r\ncapable of conceiving, namely, the production of\r\nthe higher animals, directly follows. There is\r\ngrandeur in this view of life, with its several powers,\r\nhaving been originally breathed into a few forms or\r\ninto one; and that whilst this planet has gone\r\ncycling on according to the fixed law of gravity,\r\nfrom so simple a beginning endless forms most\r\nbeautiful and most wonderful have been and are\r\nbeing evolved.\" We encounter Darwin’s epic narrative here: the drama of the “war\r\nof nature, from famine and death,” full of competition, allows his\r\nmechanism, lawful development through natural selection, to result\r\nin the “exalted” higher animals, humans. While Darwin’s diction\r\nprovides evidence of his markedly progressive view of evolution,\r\nless clear are his convictions of theism or materialism and of\r\nmutualism or competition in the epic of evolution. Though he added\r\nthe phrase “breathed by the Creator” to his second edition of The\r\nOrigin a few weeks after the first edition’s publication, whether this\r\nedit reflects a theistic understanding of natural selection or an\r\nattempt to appease theistic readers and friends remains ambiguous.\r\nSubsequent editions of The Origin retained the edit, and apologists\r\non each side of the evolutionary epic’s theist-materialist debate\r\nretained their positions.",
        "All popularizers of evolution following Charles Darwin\r\nemphasized either the theistic or materialistic version of the\r\nevolutionary epic. While most of his contemporaries interpreted his\r\ntheory of natural selection as evidence of competition ruling nature,\r\nscience writer and popularizer Arabella Buckley was the first to\r\ncharacterize Darwin’s theory of the evolution of morals as\r\nmutualistic rather than materialistic, and she did so through a unique\r\nconsolidation of evolutionary epic and spiritualism. Barbara T.\r\nGates, a scholar of Victorian women, has pointed out that a\r\ncommitment to the maternal tradition and social responsibility\r\ndrove Buckley’s contribution to the evolutionary narrative,\r\nculminating in her emphasis on the mutuality of nature. Historian\r\nof science popularization Bernard Lightman adds that Buckley’s\r\nspiritualistic beliefs directed her popularization through the genre\r\nof evolutionary epic, noting that while Gates provides a detailed\r\naccount of Buckley’s narrative techniques and goals, her exclusion\r\nof Buckley’s religion restricts her analysis. In light of the\r\nconversation between these scholars, I aim to demonstrate that the significance of Buckley’s distinctive, mutualistic addition to the\r\ndebate on the evolution of morals lies in her theory of traducianism,\r\nneatly unifying evolutionary epic, mutualism, and spiritualism."],

At its completion sometime around 2050, it will connect the southern Yangtze River and northern Yellow River with 2,700 miles of tunnels and canals via three distinct routes through western, central and eastern China. This project is ecologically irresponsible and economically inefficient, but government officials staunchly defend it by highlighting its connection with historical Chinese water-use practices and its promise of sustaining economic growth. While water scarcity is a serious and growing problem in China, this project will have far-reaching, devastating, and unforeseeable consequences and will therefore exacerbate existing problems while introducing new ones. The Chinese government should instead pursue self-sufficient, environmentally friendly alternatives in lieu of this grandiose and wasteful water transfer scheme. Such alternatives can be realized, but only if Beijing can learn to adapt to the country’s environmental realities and successfully promote water conservation practices."],

        "Although political theorists at one time believed that\r\nreligion was on the decline as a global political force, the consensus amongst contemporary scholars is quite the contrary—rather than fading into obscurity, religion has emerged as a powerful influence in the wake of increasing modernization and globalization. Islam, as the world’s second largest religion, is no exception to this trend. An Islamic resurgence began with intellectuals in the first half of the 20th century and by the 1970s had become politically influential globally. This revival of Islam in the public sphere led to Muslims the world over demanding regimes that favored Islamic law and morality. Regrettably, this reemergence of religion in public life and international politics has given rise to an increase in religious extremist groups and movements, which include many Islamist and radical Muslim campaigns. Women play a variety of roles in extremist organizations including that of the victim, supporter, dissident, or active participant. This study will attempt to examine the role of women in modern Islamist extremist movements. I will analyze the contributions of women in the formation and maintenance of such movements and the motivations of women who support or join. Additionally, I will investigate current efforts and tactics to hinder Islamist extremism, and the ways in which feminism and women’s empowerment can be mobilized to counter Islamist extremism."],

      abstract: ["Prior to the mid-twentieth century, when assisted reproductive technologies (ART) stepped on to the medical scene, supplications and prayers to God were the primary means for religious Jewish couples to cope with the issue of infertility. However, with the advent of artificial insemination techniques, fertility hormones, in vitro fertilization, and surrogacy, new medical technologies have successfully generated proactive methods for infertile individuals to have biological children of their own. Yet as these controversial technologies emerge, and prove to be of interest and use to Jewish persons, rabbis are compelled to contend with this new and challenging issue. In an effort to comply with halakha, or rabbinic law, modern rabbis have interpreted ART in various ways, putting restrictions on certain forms and implementing guidelines for their use in general. For religious Orthodox Jews, halakha is a prominent feature of everyday life that influences his or her actions and interactions in the most direct way. Because of this observance, Orthodox couples undergoing fertility treatment and utilizing ART take seriously the guidance of their rabbis, who are seen as authorities on halakha. Consequently, a potential problem that emerges from the halakhic discourse on assisted reproductive technologies is that this set of symbolically-loaded medical procedures takes place within the female body, yet is dictated by the tractates ofa male-dominated religious legal system. The purpose of this paper, then, is to utilize feminist critiques of gender bias in legal systems to critically analyze Orthodox rabbinic discourse on assisted reproductive technologies. Due the unique cultural situation in Israel, which boasts a relatively strong Modern Orthodox presence, a pro-natal government, and unparalleled access to cheap fertility treatments for its citizens, this research will also reflect on the social and political ramifications rabbinic rulings have on the assisted reproductive scene in Israel. Additionally, this paper will reflect on the importance of working within the halakhic system to achieve greater gender equality, and explore potential options for Orthodox feminists to realize that goal."],

These hidden dangers were painfully revealed in 2008 and 2009, when the ballooning housing, stock, and mortgage-backed security markets imploded simultaneously, bringing about the worst domestic recession since the Great Depression (“Financial Crisis Response”). Measured from 2006-2009, the “credit crisis” increased unemployment from 4.6% to over 10%, reduced US stock market capitalization by almost $5 trillion, decreased real gross private investment by a staggering 31.42%, and resulted in the federal government doling out over $1.1 trillion of aid to prevent the failure of well-established corporations including AIG, JPMorgan Chase, General Motors, and the GSEs Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (Kolb 261-269). Unraveling the complex series of events that created the financial crisis remains challenging, since “no single cause [of the crisis] can be identified” (Kolb xi). However, one factor lies at the center of this web of causality: over-the-counter, mortgage-backed derivatives. The 2008 financial crisis clearly illustrates how the unregulated over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market has the inherent tendency and capacity to create securities capable of toppling financial markets."],

Instead of being treated as a minority group that is given preferential treatment in college admissions, the opposite is occurring for Asian American students of East Asian or Indian descent. In college admissions, affirmative action policies often result in an Asian American student being passed over in favor of a non- Asian American minority student with lower grades, test scores, or achievements (Espenshade & Chung, 2005). This paper aims to illustrate that regarding college admissions, even though affirmative action policies were aimed at helping minorities, they have hurt Asian American students of East Asian or Indian descent more than they have benefited these students. The paper also includes a discussion on alternatives to affirmative action policies that are fair to all racial/ethnic groups, the future of college admissions policies, and whether America is ready to \neliminate affirmative action policies."],

      abstract: ["Visual images of the drunken, vanishing, or stoic Indian are commonplace within the popular imagination. Indigenous films have provided a medium to challenge and refute these stereotypes. As a Native American writer and filmmaker, Sherman Alexie aims to blur and destabilize the boundaries at the intersections of these categories. Only then do these categories become tangible and meaningful, particularly in regard to their role in comprising the modern Indian identity. Through his film, The Business of Fancydancing, Sherman Alexie explores the themes of alcoholism, reservation life, and masculinity within the Native American condition to challenge his audience to negotiate multiple identities. He subverts the stereotypes and categorization of these themes through developing characters who struggle to reconcile these themes within their own identities. With films featuring relatable characters that are complex and flawed, Alexie cultivates sovereignty of self-identity as an artistic and sociocultural practice through filmmaking."],

While this little population “prediction” does provide a nice laugh, it also speaks to the increasingly litigious nature of American society in recent times. Americans, in general, respect the rule of law, but they are also becoming increasingly involved with it in a variety of fields and topics. Thus, it should be alarming to Americans that justice is not being properly dispensed everywhere in the country. The United States Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals appears as an anomaly in the judicial system. Spanning from Arizona to Alaska and from Montana to Guam, the Ninth Circuit jumps off the map when compared to other circuits. It encompasses the states of Arizona, California, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Alaska, Hawaii; the territory of Guam; and the commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (Roll 2007, 109). It covers more states (nine) than any other circuit with one of them, California, being the most populous state in the nation and two, Arizona and Nevada, among the fastest growing states. Therefore, it is no surprise that the Ninth Circuit houses close to a fifth of the population with around 60 million people on about forty percent of the country’s land (Roll 2007, 110)."],

One system of healthcare delivery that has occupied a powerful position due to its origins in dominating countries is the western medical perspective. The development of the western viewpoint of disease resulted from an emphasis on observations and the sciences, such as chemistry and biology, which are constantly changing in the body during various stages ofhealth and illness. This perspective has enabled the broadening of knowledge about physiological processes of the body and the development of incredible technological and pharmaceutical medical interventions. However, in viewing the human body as a center for cause and effect with biological processes and chemical interactions, traditional western medicine has set up the approach of separating the body from the mind and physical characteristics from the emotional and spiritual characteristics in the prevention and treatment of sickness."],

Described as “a frenzied artist,” she designed books, magazines, posters, advertisements, as well as textiles, clothing, and costumes. On top of that, she was an author and poet. Her design style and aesthetic was avant garde, modern, and often characterized by simplicity and geometric forms and patterns, but Varvara was never content with stasis. She constantly evolved her style and worked to develop new concepts and ideas. As a co-founder of the Constructivist movement, her work typifies the aesthetic and philosophies of Constructivism. While Varavara worked on many of her own projects, she also did many together with her husband, Alexander Rodchenko, another well-known Constructivist designer. Her work often gets linked to Rodchenko’s, and it’s Rodchenko who gets mentioned in histories of graphic design and credit for designs that should be attributed to Stepanova as well. At a time when women were largely still expected to be no more than wives and mothers, Stepanova was a woman who made an unmistakable mark on art and design."],

After graduating from Chouinard and marrying Lee Blair, Mary was set to build a career as a regionalist watercolor painter like her husband. Due to World War 2, fine art was not working out, and the two entered the world of commercial art and animation. Both landed positions at Ub Iwerks Studio. In 1940, Blair joined Walt Disney studios as a sketch artist. The job frustrated her, and she quit shortly after. A few months later, Walt Disney animators went on strike in 1941, right when Walt left on a Goodwill tour of South America. Lee Blair was invited to go with a group of Disney artists. Mary desperately wanted to go, so she convinced Walt to bring her. The South American tour was where Mary Blair flourished as an artist and developed the style we know of today. Walt supported and encouraged her work and involved her in a number of projects back at the studios. Blair was the art director on the films Three Caballeros and Saludos Amigos, and concept artist for Cinderella, Alice in Wonderland, and Peter Pan. Blair left the Disney studios and moved to New York to pursue freelance commercial art. She illustrated for Little Golden Books, did set designs for Radio City Music Hall, and designed ads for Bakers Cocoa and Pall Mall. Mary returned to Disney for her biggest project yet: creating the look for a new Disneyland attraction called \"It's a Small World.\" Mary Blair's modern style had a huge impact on the way Disney created their films and her influence at Disney can be seen to this day."],

Chi squared test for independence was used to determine the relationship between DSS use and diagnostic error rates. There were three main findings of the study: (1) use of a DSS by a critical care physician can decrease diagnostic error by up to 60%; (2) 56% of critical care physicians are using a DSS during diagnosis to learn something new, confirm something they already knew, and/or to reassure themselves; and (3) the increased use of a DSS by critical care physicians can lead to a decrease in the belief of the ability of a DSS to reduce diagnostic error."],

Based on a literature review of similar programs and observation of our own campus, locations were designated and assigned. To provide consistent service, each librarian was given a specific site which they visited once per week during the same day and two-hour increment. Review of the pilot program showed positive impact. The librarians took the spring semester to address issues and renewed the program, as a permanent outreach of the library services, in the fall of 2017. This poster will include information about how we implemented the program, the impact it has on campus, and commentary about faculty and student interest and participation.

Originally from Brazil, Feitler eventually found her home in New York City and made a name for herself in the magazine industry. Early on in her career she was named co-art director of Harper’s Bazaar along with Ruth Ansel, both having served as graphic designers under art director Marvin Israel (1924-85) who had been one of Feitler’s instructors at Parsons. Known for taking chances, Feitler and Ansel pushed Harper’s to its limits. Under Feitler’s and Ansel’s direction, Harper’s became one of the first national publications to photograph and feature an African American model. After leaving Harper’s, Feitler got involved with Ms., a liberal feminist publication founded by Gloria Steinem and Dorothy Pitman Hughes. At Ms. Magazine, Feitler was responsible for many controversial covers including one for a December (Christmas) issue, which featured the slogan “Peace on Earth, Good Will toward People,” revising the historically patriarchal statement “Peace on Earth, Good Will toward Men.” Despite a relatively short career, due to her untimely death at age 44, she made a significant impact on magazine design while also taking a stand for feminism and equality."],

      abstract: ["Comic books have been an aspect of culture in the United States since the late 1930s, since their inception, they have constantly reflected the attitudes, troubles and trends of the time. Because comic books follow historical trends so closely, they serve as a literary device that reflects the attitudes of the general population. This thesis explores the super hero narrative through comic books, in an effort to draw historical inclinations about perceived cultural enemies of United States societies from the 1940s to 2015. Since the super hero narrative gained momentum in 1938 with the debut issue of Superman, in Action Comics number one, superheroes have interpreted features of everyday life on a regular weekly schedule. Since comic books often mirror society, one can use comic books to create a vivid interpretation of past key events with the combination of literature and artistic illustrations that comic books and graphic novels offer. Although the use of comic books being an avenue for historical interpretation is not new, what is new is the concept of using comic books to interpret and understand the cultural enemies of American society from the 1940s to 2015. In regards to this body of work, cultural enemies are defined as any group of people or negative traits of society that any large group of United States citizens believed had the potential to threaten the ability to pursue or maintain the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Such cultural threats include the Nazi Party, and Islamic State threat to the general population, the crime wave of the 1970s for populations living in cities and instances of racial injustice as seen in the 1990s that effected the African American population. Since World War II, and the dropping of the atomic bombs, the United States has been a hegemon to countries around the world. In acting as a world leader, the United States has had its share of cultural enemies both foreign and domestic. This thesis offers an in-depth perspective into the comic book industry and extracts examples of perceived cultural threats to various United States societies throughout the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s-1990s, and into the modern era of 2012-2016. The hope of this academic work is to shed light on the underutilization of comic books as historical resources. Comic books and graphic novels in conjunction with standard textbooks and knowledgeable instructors have the potential to create a more holistic and engaging learning environment for young students and adults. This thesis analyses various characters and series from a range of comic book publishers, in order to connect real world trends and events with specific comic book issues reflecting the attitudes of multiple populations regarding enemies threatening the United States cultural principles of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness for all."],

      abstract: ["The Yellow City' takes place in the course of one day and follows the stories of several characters. The first six chapters outline each character, giving a detailed description of who they are as individuals. The main characters are comprised of Katriona, the beautiful, and promiscuous restaurant manager who has been highly sexualized by all of the men in her life. E, or Edward, a black kid from Harlem who cannot find a way to escape his socioeconomic circumstances. Scott, a quirky, selfish finance banker who is grappling with his sexual identity. A homeless man who faces the struggles of severe mental illness and also the harshness of the New York City landscape. And Sylvie, a former mid-westerner who is fiercely codependent on her lover... This specific day happens to be highly significant to each character in some way. They all find themselves in various types of trouble or unidealistic circumstances... E gets some weed he is carrying for a dangerous, neighborhood thug stolen off him, Sylvie finds out her lover is having an affair, Scott is threatened with a gun if he doesn't extort money from his bank firm. Perhaps the biggest break is with Katriona, though, as she is approached by a disturbing man on the Subway and told that her life is in jeopardy. He threatens her, and demands that she remain aboard and tell nobody of their conversation. He mentions to her that he will return, then saunters off. Near the end of the novel their stories converge. One by one, each of the characters make their way onto the same train car. The strange man makes good on his promise and re-enters the scene, threatening to kill them all if they don't play his bizarre game, a storytelling, Russian roulette, of sorts. Both alone, and together, they try to keep themselves alive."],

Malthus, Adam Smith, and Jeremy Bentham, Harriet Martineau (1802-1876) was commissioned by Henry, Lord Brougham, to develop a series of similar pamphlets discussing their shared desire for poor law reform. These pamphlets served to explain the proposed amendments Brougham and other parliamentary Radicals and Whigs hoped to pass through Parliament. Using the personal legislative drafts of Lord Brougham, Martineau published Poor Laws and Paupers Illustrated throughout 1833 and 1834 under condition of anonymity. In these pamphlets, Martineau not only popularized Malthusian political economy, like in her earlier series, but in fact reformulated it by delineating the crucial components of a moral and progressive society. Indeed, with Poor Laws and Paupers Illustrated, Martineau was no longer simply a popularizer of science, but in fact stood at the forefront of the science of wealth known as political economy."],

      abstract: ["There is debate if a high aerobic capacity will improve recovery from repeated bouts of sprinting, which primarily taxes the anaerobic energy systems. The relationship between aerobic capacity and repeat sprint ability in ice hockey players is not well established; moreover, the relationships that have been examined involved off-ice testing protocols, which lack specificity to the ice hockey. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between on-ice aerobic capacity (VO2peak and VIIT) and repeated on-ice sprint ability (RISA) via percentage of power output decrement (%DPO), and other measurements of on-ice power output (OPO). Methods: 11 male professional ice hockey players, recruited from an American Hockey League team, participated in two maximal effort on-ice tests. Aerobic capacity was tested via the 30-15 Intermittent Ice Test. Gas exchange was measured directly measured via an Oxycon portable O2 analyzer in four of the participants. OPO was measured via the Repeat Ice Skating Test. The relationship between these variables for nine of the participants was then analyzed via Pearson's correlational testing. Results: There was no significant relationship between VIIT or VO2peak to %DPO (r =-.036 and .197 respectively; p > .05) or any other measurement of RISA. Discussion: The results from this study suggest that aerobic capacity was not related to RISA. While the results were not statistically significant, likely due to a small sample size, the effect size for %DPO and aerobic capacity (VIIT and VO2peak) was small, indicating that the relationship was nearly negligible. Elite level ice hockey players may not have a better RISA resultant from a higher aerobic capacity."],

The first part of the study uses OLS regression to estimate the effects of art policies on reading, math, and science standardized test scores. The results show that individual policies, as well as the total number of policies, have significant effects on the test scores. The second part compares the graduation and attendance rates, Academic Performance Index scores, and A-F Grades of Oklahoma schools that are OKA+ against those that are not. The results illustrate that while there was no significant difference between the two in A-F Grades, schools that prioritize art education do have higher graduation and attendance rates, as well as higher Academic Performance Index scores.

The answer itself, while important, was not the motivation behind this research, but the actors who influenced the answer were. Specifically, the sovereign credit rating agencies influenced the process by implying that if drastic steps were not taken, they would downgrade United States debt. In influencing a decision by the largest economic actor in the world, the ratings agencies showed that they possessed authority in the global economy. If they could influence United States policy, who else could they influence? Furthermore, what variables are factored into their rating? This research explores the impact of private governance, specifically ratings agencies, on seventeen developing states and attempts to explain variations in ratings over a span of six years (2004-2009) using Fitch's ratings service. The model accounted for 77% of variations in ratings. The resulting correlations showed that the Gini coefficient, the current account, and a variable called GDP volatility that refers to GDP growth and contraction, were significantly negatively correlated with variations in rating; and a globalization score was significantly positively correlated with variations in rating. These results imply that in developing states, increasing globalization, reducing income inequality, running surpluses, and maintaining small steady growth in GDP result in higher credit ratings, and that states attempting to develop should pursue policies that achieve those goals.--Abstract."],

The State’s position follows a playbook all too familiar to citizens of Indian Country, resurfacing antiquated beliefs about what it means to be a tribal citizen and misrepresenting the historical forces that animate Oklahoma’s statehood movements. Writing with historians, Indigenous people, and interdisciplinary scholarship, this thesis will incorporate the analytical tools of Critical Indigenous Studies alongside archival and empirical methodologies. This thesis contextualizes Oklahoma’s tribal-state governance dynamic as a contest for land, resources, and life made possible by the logic of settler colonialism and white nationalism instrumental in both contemporary and historic struggles for American Indian legal and political recognition. To do this, I look at the contested history of Indigenous land tenure in Oklahoma beginning with Charles Page and the establishment of Sand Springs in chapter two, followed by the enmeshment of blood politics and internalized colonialism in chapter three, and ending chapter four with an analysis of three distinct statehood movements preceding Oklahoma’s entrance to the United States."],

      abstract: ["Advertising is a billion-dollar business, largely invested in television commercials. Although advertising in technology-based contexts such as Internet sites and digital video recording systems is increasing, television advertising remains in the top percentage of expenditures. The purpose of this investigation was to facilitate positive explicit and implicit attitudes toward featured products and services. The Implicit Association Test (IAT) is a putative measure of the robustness of non-conscious associations between concepts. In the IAT, participants categorize words or pictures as rapidly as possible. Concepts with compatible associations such as YOUNG=HAPPY produce faster and more accurate categorization times than concepts with incompatible associations such as YOUNG=DISASTER. Effective television commercials produce positive associations between the featured product and the concept GOOD, which should increase categorization times to associations such as PRODUCT=HAPPY and slow response times to associations such as PRODUCT=DISASTER. In the current study, undergraduates watched a television program embedded with foreign commercials before completing an IAT. The logos for products reappeared in the IAT (old products) with logos for new products. The hypothesis that positive associations were faster and more accurate for old products versus novel products was not supported.--Abstract."],

      abstract: ["Microwave and radiofrequency heating has great promise in many engineering and biomedical applications because of its non-contact, volumetric heat generation and selective heating. However, the heating patterns and temperature distributions are non-uniform and difficult to control. Electromagnetic power absorption guides the heating pattern which is a complex function of dielectric properties, electromagnetic frequencies, size, and shape of the target object. A closed form expression of power absorption with functional relationship with various parameters is obtained for a spherical shaped dielectric object using Maxwell's equations in spherical coordinate. Maxwell's equations are solved using vector potentials and separation of variables. Mathematical tools such as Bessel functions, Legendre Polynomials, infinite series, and complex number expressions are employed in finding the solution. The electromagnetic power absorption is calculated from the knowledge of electromagnetic field within the object using Poynting theorem. The analytical expression of the electric field, magnetic field, and power generation within the sphere are coded in MATLAB and FORTRAN to get numerical results for spherical shaped meat balls of 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 5.0 cm radii with varying properties and electromagnetic frequencies of 2800 MHz, 2450 MHz, 915 MHz, and 300 MHz. Origin Labs is utilized to produce 1-D plots and also 2-D polar plots by reading the data text files generated in the FORTRAN program. Results show that the presence of local maxima of electric and magnetic field strength due to the constructive interference of the electromagnetic wave in the target object. The spatial distribution of microwave power absorption follows the trend of electromagnetic field distribution. The locations of local maxima and minima of power absorption and electromagnetic field distributions vary with the radius of the sphere and applied frequencies. The results also show that the strength of the absorbed electromagnetic wave at the 2450 MHz is most non-uniform at the radius of 3 cm nugget. The smallest (1 cm radius) and largest (5 cm radius) dielectric radii show a lower electromagnetic and power generation peak values but a more even distribution of energy overall. Analysis reveals the correlations of propagating wavelength, penetration depth of electromagnetic waves and size of the beef nuggets. Results indicate that the uniform and effective electromagnetic power absorption can be facilitated by proper design of the object of interest and selection of appropriate frequencies. This rigorous analytic investigation will provide significant insight in understanding the power absorption and temperature distribution mechanism for spherical shaped objects under electromagnetic wave (microwave and radiofrequency) treatment."],

      abstract: ["The primary intent of this research is to evaluate and deduce events, leading up to, during, and after, the restoration of the Catholic hierarchy in Great Britain. The culmination of this work questions the perception of how reactionist British Protestants opposed this sudden policy stemming from the Vatican and if such opposition vilified English Catholics, despite their own national distinction. These accounts will also establish both political and public responses against these papal designs and conclude that the traditional Catholic vs. Protestant remained a secondary priority, this British opposition sought to limit and restrict the influence of a foreign institution upon a susceptible minority of the population. This culminated in a mass of public outcries and governmental policies directed against the pope, his Catholic bishops, and institutions in an effort to regulate and contain papal influence. Hence, despite the traditional Protestant arguments, these measures still, to an extent, recognized English Catholics as British subjects and ultimately resulted as an anti-imperialist response to thwart a foreign outlet in the heart of the British Empire. This area of study commences with controversy surrounding the Oxford Movement in the 1840s, the climatic events that occurred in 1850, and ends with circumstances leading up to radical church renovations and demolitions in the following decades. Given the immense public pressure being exerted upon Parliament during the early months of the restoration of the Catholic hierarchy, a considerable number of sources are surrounding policy and public opinion within London. Yet other materials also consider anti-papal reaction directed towards the Oxford Movement. The dichotomy of the newspapers of this mid-Victorian Era include, The Era, The Times, The London Standard, The Morning Chronicle, The Worcester Journal, and others. Primary sources reflect the public statements and correspondence of Prime Minister Lord John Russell, Cardinal Nicholas Wiseman, and Archbishop Archibald C. Tait. These particular sources are indicated the British Library and Lambeth Palace Library. The British Library consisted of a majority of correspondence letters, some within manuscripts and other published, sent to and from the prime minister addressing the problem of the restoration of the Catholic hierarchy. A considerable number of published sources from ultra-conservative Protestants is considered. To this effect, the archives within Lambeth Palace and published works within the British Library have contributed a host of rare and unique sources attributing to this research."],

      abstract: ["Harris mud crab, Rhithropanopeus harrisii, is a small euryhaline crab native to the brackish waters of the Atlantic coast of North America. R. harrisii was discovered in Lake Texoma in 2008 and are thought to have originated from Texas estuaries. To date, there have been no comprehensive studies conducted on the Lake Texoma population of Harris mud crab. The objectives of this project were to 1) record sex and morphometrics, 2) note microhabitat preferences, 3) determine reproductive periods, 4) document current distribution, and 5) estimate the population size of R. harrisii in Lake Texoma over a decade following the initial discovery. Six sampling sites were established along a transect from the OU Biological Station to near the Denison Dam. Sites were sampled from August 2019 to August 2021. A total of 1,396 crabs were observed with 1,326 collected for analyses. Results showed the majority of crabs in Lake Texoma were right-handed. There was no significant difference in average carapace width between males and females, however males made up the highest percentage of the upper size classes. Males also attained larger claw sizes than females likely due to intraspecific competition for females. Both sexes of R. harrisii in Lake Texoma are smaller in terms of body size than crabs from other geographic locations. Small size could be the result of stressful conditions or early fatality. A male-biased sex ratio was observed in the Lake Texoma population. Abundance and distribution of crabs varied across the lake, likely due to salinity values and microhabitat availability of each site. Population densities in Lake Texoma were higher than those observed in other locations but the densities of crabs at each site were extremely patchy. Seasonal trends established a difference in crab frequency during the warm and cool seasons. A drop in lake level during late winter of 2020 confirmed that the crabs migrate to deeper water to take refuge from the cold temperatures. The presence of larvae and gravid females suggests a reproductive period from June to October and confirms the successful establishment of Harris mud crab in Lake Texoma. This project will provide state and local officials with baseline information and methodology they can use to monitor the Lake Texoma population of Harris mud crab in the future. Lastly, this study will provide a greater overall understanding of the invasive Harris mud crabs in a freshwater, reservoir habitat."],

A better understanding of the effects of static stretching could help improve athletic performance. The purpose of this study was to determine the acute and delayed effects of static stretching on muscular power performance in female collegiate soccer players. The participants were healthy, uninjured volunteers who were soccer players from the University of Central Oklahoma womenâ€™s soccer team (n = 13). Each participant was led through a dynamic only stretching condition and a combination stretching condition. The focus of the stretching conditions was the large muscle groups of the lower body. The two stretching conditions were completed on nonconsecutive days in the same week. Following the stretching condition, the participant completed three trials of a countermovement jump (CMJ), three trials of a instep kick, and two trials of the Illinois Agility Test (IAT) for the acute testing. The participants then had a 30-minute rest period followed by another round of CMJ, instep kicking, and IAT trials to complete the delayed testing. Dependent t-tests were completed to compare the acute and delayed testing of the dynamic only and combination conditions. The results indicated non-significant differences between the acute dynamic only stretching condition and combination stretching conditions, as well as between the delayed dynamic only stretching condition and combination stretching condition (p < .05). Researchers concluded that there is no significant effect of static stretching on muscular power performance in female collegiate soccer players. Although the calculated effect sizes of the study did show trends of static stretching having a positive effect on muscular power for all variables except for acute CMJ heights and acute and delayed IAT performance. Future research should assess the effects of static stretching on muscular power in larger sample size of female and male collegiate soccer players."],

There has been little research conducted identifying reasons why Asian Indians have higher rates of cardiovascular disease. These rates have severe public health and financial implications. The purpose of this research was to determine what health behaviors may lead to this high prevalence of cardiovascular disease. The hypothesis was that lack of physical activity and length of time living in the U.S. contribute the most to a higher risk of morbidity, mortality, and cardiovascular disease among people from India and Pakistan living in the United States for at least 10 years. A survey comprised of questions about physical activity, cardiovascular health, food and vegetable consumption, and level of acculturation was given to a group of Indian and Pakistani people residing in the U.S. for at least 10 years. This study was a pilot study and had a descriptive design. The significance or alpha level for this study was set at 0.05. Pearson's correlation tests were used to assess relationships between multiple variables; no significance was found in this cohort. Independent samples t-tests were used to assess differences in variables among men and women; no significance was found in this cohort; however, a trend towards significance was found when looking for differences between men and women's acculturation scores.

Though influenced by a number of long-standing cultural and philosophical traditions, the Chinese Communist Party Central Military Commission (CCP CMC) relied on Mao Zedong's approach to warfare. Indeed, this doctrine guided Chinese military thought and theory for much of the early twentieth century as the Red Army, the guerrillas of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), transitioned into the People's Liberation Army (PLA), the conventional forces of the People's Republic of China (PRC). Even after the creation of the PRC, the PLA and especially the Chinese People's Volunteer Forces (CPVF) in Korea continued to operate under this doctrine because of the limited industrial and economic development of China. This subscription to Mao military thought, however, did not completely divorce the doctrine of the PRC from traditional approaches to war. Indeed, the revolutionary guerrilla warfare of Mao demonstrated clear continuity with the methods of eras past such as pragmatism, efficiency, and adaptability. The experiences CPVF troops gained from the stalemate of the Korean War demonstrated several implications for the future of the twenty-first century. The Korean War revealed the limited capabilities of revolutionary guerrilla war outside of the country where the cultural-national troops originated. It also demonstrated the military power of the PRC and its ability to halt the advances of industrialized and technologically superior Western forces, signaling the reestablishment of Chinese political and cultural dominance of Asia. Perhaps most important as a \"lessons taught\" approach to history, the CPVF demonstrated the viability of revolutionary guerrilla warfare as a means for struggling, former colonial states to combat the supposed strengths of Western, industrialized, and modern state military powers."],

While preserving these documents an acquisition history will be written for the museum to use for future endeavors, including but not limited to the grant applications for building renovations they are currently working towards. The documents preserved and used in this project range from purchase receipts made by the museum in various years, a general museum history written in 1966, deed of gift which document the many gifts given to the museum in the form of historical objects, letter correspondences dealing with the many concerns that come with running a museum, and photographs of objects within the museum collection.

Oklahoma State University (OSU) also experiences high rates of food insecurity. A recent study found that approximately 42% of OSU Stillwater students were food insecure and sophomores, upperclassmen, and minority students were at the highest risk. The 2020 study found the food insecure students at OSU were not utilizing the food security resources available to them. The purpose of this mixed methods study was to understand why students are not utilizing the available food security resources. The first phase was qualitative and utilized interviews with sophomores, juniors, and senior-level OSU students to identify obstacles preventing resource utilization. Randomized email lists were used for recruitment, and participation was encouraged in ethnically diverse campus organizations. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed for emerging themes. The quantitative phase was informed by the interview results, and included a social media campaign promoted throughout campus using A-Frames. This intervention utilized the social media platform Instagram to promote available resources to students. Student engagement in the intervention was measured by the number of QR scans and Instagram analytics. To measure the effectiveness of increasing resource awareness, a survey was administered to Instagram followers through a direct message. The results of the qualitative phase demonstrated a major limitation in student resource usage is a lack of awareness, and the best way to distribute information on campus was social media and A-Frames. Overall, students at OSU Stillwater are facing food insecurity but are not aware of the resources available; the use of A-frames and social media demonstrate potential to increase awareness. The long-term implication of this study is a reduced prevalence of food insecurity at OSU Stillwater's campus."],

Reproductive work in prairie voles is somewhat limited, with more emphasis placed on behavior than physiology. The female prairie vole estrus cycle is unique in that the females do not begin estrus cycling until exposed to a non-relative male. It is unknown if/how female exposure and pair bonding affect male sperm characteristics and/or production. Here we utilize male prairie voles as a study model for if/how pair bonding and monogamy affect sperm production and characteristics. Prior to comparing sperm characteristics between mated and unmated males, we establish an effective methodology for epididymal sperm extraction and analysis utilizing established techniques in other rodents, modern theriogenology concepts, and trial and error. This methodology displays statistical significance and consistency based on established reproductive parameters in mammals, and is thus appropriate to utilize for study group comparisons moving forward. We now turn our attention to the differences between unmated males and mated monogamous males. Preliminary data indicates a likely statistical difference in sperm characteristics between these groups, but more data is needed to reach an objective conclusion."],

Anthocyanin concentration, total phenolic content, and two radical scavenging assays were used. Compared to white phenotypes, purple genotypes had significantly higher anthocyanin concentrations (142 to 298%) in each environment and higher total phenolics (103.85 and 105%) in the 2021 environments. Additionally, delayed harvest appeared to be associated with decreased anthocyanin and phenolic concentrations in purple wheat, which could point to the importance of timely harvest to preserve pigments and nutritional functionality.

These fungi aid in digestion in ruminants, pseudoruminants, and nonruminants alike, where they adhere to plant biomass and produce enzymes and bioactive molecules that break down complex sugars. This includes the degradation of cellulose, which is essential in the development of biofuels and other biotechnologies converting plant biomass to products of commercial value. Marsupials, non-placental mammals who split from placental mammals ~125 Mya, have shown strong microscopic and sequence-based evidence for harboring AGF. Marsupial herbivores are promising hosts for uncovering novel AGF because some species are foregut fermenters (kangaroos and wallabies) and others are hindgut fermenters (koalas and wombats), both digestive methods that are associated with AGF presence in other herbivores. Due to their laborious maintenance procedures, strict anaerobic nature, and technical difficulties in genomic sequencing, these microorganisms are under-researched and poorly sampled.",
        "We hypothesized that marsupials represent a yet-untapped reservoir for discovering novel AGF taxa. To test this hypothesis, we collected fresh fecal samples from a wide range of marsupials and are currently attempting to enrich and isolate novel AGF taxa from these samples. Using complex media amended with plant substrates, strict anaerobic techniques, and multiple antibiotics for suppressing growth, we were able to enrich for AGF, as evident by visual production of hyphal filaments in enrichment tubes. We are currently undertaking purification procedures to isolate axenic cultures of AGF for subsequent identification and characterization. Culturing novel AGF from marsupials will allow for deeper perspectives on the diversity and biology of anaerobic gut fungi and will enable their applications in veterinary medicine, biofuels, and biomedical engineering."],

      abstract: ["Formation of new carbon-carbon bonds lies at the heart of organic chemistry. Radical intermediates are particularly well suited for reaction with a host of reaction partners to yield new carbon'carbon bonds and alkyl halides are the typical choice for precursors. Unfortunately, the difficulty of converting various alkyl halides to carbon-centered radicals varies dramatically depending on the structure. Thus, a method that could facilitate and normalize the reduction of the alkyl halides would be advantageous as it would allow this ubiquitous class of molecules to become more synthetically useful. Previous research from the group has shown that collidinium salts can be made from alkyl halides and that these salts are excellent radical precursors for photocatalytic reactions because they normalize the reduction potentials. This was demonstrated by the development of a Giese addition to electron poor alkenes to give the corresponding alkylated alkane. The collidinium salts prevented side reactions that occurred in other salts, leading to higher yields and other positive reaction attributes; however, the ortho methyl groups hindered the nucleophilicity. This reduction in nucleophilicity presented a major drawback because it made creating the salts in situ challenging. In most cases, the synthesis of the collidinium salts required high temperatures and long reaction times which limited the range of potential substrates. In this work, we are exploring lutidine salts made from the corresponding alkyl halide and lutidine (m, m-dimethylpyridine) as viable alternatives. They exhibit similar desirable properties in terms of redox potential but have a reduced steric demand which is expected to enhance the precursor's nucleophilicity and enables more facile salt formation in situ. Importantly, the undesired side reaction tends to attack at the ortho and para-position and substitution at the meta-position appears to be sufficient to halt this process. Investigation of lutidine salts under photocatalytic conditions is expected to ultimately provide a new avenue to expand the utility of alkyl halides through a dual catalysis sequence involving both photo- and nucleophilic-catalysis."],

Current dosimeters for monitoring crew radiation dosage are often expensive and bulky. We propose a compact and economical design for a dosimeter suited for rocket flight. Drawing from established detector architectures, our design centers on a silicon PIN photodiode detector coupled to a charge sensitive preamplifier and pulse shaping amplifier. When a particle deposits energy into the active region of the photodiode, a current pulse is converted to a voltage pulse by the preamplifier, which is processed by the shaping amplifier to be read by an analog to digital converter. Measurements from this process will be used for obtaining dose rate as a function of time. To calibrate the dosimeter, known radioactive sources were used. A mounting system is subsequently being developed for rocket flight. Resulting prototypes will be flown with the OSU High Altitude Rocketry Club, and later models on the NASA WB-57 research aircraft, Blue Origin's New Shepard, and the International Space Station. The development of flight-ready radiation detectors made of readily available electronic components stands to make rocket-borne dosimetry more economical, providing another tool in the analysis of space and near-space radiation environments."],

      abstract: ["A mathematics teacher's instruction is informed by their pedagogical knowledge (teaching theories and tactics) and content knowledge (ability to solve and understand math problems). A successful teacher must utilize both of these knowledge bases to support students' conceptual learning of mathematics. Rate of change is one of the foundational topics within mathematics - it is essential to understanding function properties and representations and is the basis for calculus and differential equations. Ideally, one would apply covariational reasoning to develop a productive conception of constant, average, and instantaneous rate of change. Covariational reasoning, refers to the cognitive actions occurring when an individual relates the way two varying quantities change together. Previously conducted interviews by my research mentors were recorded and are now being analyzed to determine how the subject's meanings for constant rate of change progressed and to discern how the subject's learning was influenced by her covariational reasoning. During the interviews, the participant was given increasingly more difficult rate of change problems to solve and discuss. At times, she struggled to solve a new problem using the methods she had previously employed. However, she also had moments of growth in her reasoning and problem-solving approaches. We hope to distinguish and emphasize the differences between her approaches to solving constant rate of change problems. The goal of this journal submission is to effectively communicate the transition between a well-known tiered model of mental conceptualizations of rate of change previously reported in literature in order to aid students' critical thinking skills and teachers' abilities to support students' learning of this foundational concept. This journal article will also illustrate how teachers must recognize possible misconceptions that may be developed through the introduction of rate of change; they are not always obvious until later when more complex problems are introduced but a student defaults to what they are comfortable with. By being conscientious of the relationships within covariational reasoning, teachers can aid in students' understanding in their class and the students' future mathematics courses as well."],

      abstract: ["Individual variation in behavioral traits, commonly referred to as 'personality,' is exhibited in numerous animal species, including invertebrates. The specific personality trait of exploration tendency may be affected by positive/optimistic or negative/pessimistic emotional states. Animal contests can induce these emotions, as winning against one's opponent increases 'optimism', while losing causes 'pessimism'; these states can then affect behavior in other contexts. Previous studies demonstrate that house crickets (Acheta domesticus) experience this winner-loser effect in fights, thus we investigated if a cricket's exploratory behavior is influenced by the outcome of its contest. We predicted that after a fight, winners would exhibit increased exploratory behavior due to an optimistic emotional state, while losers would show decreased exploratory behavior due to a pessimistic emotional state. Exploration tendency was measured as an individual's latency to exit a shelter, tested twice for repeatability. Crickets then participated in an aggression contest, with opponents randomly chosen to be either smaller or larger so that focal individuals either won (n=20) or lost (n=17), respectively. Latency was again measured after the contest, as well as 48 hours later to examine the persistence of winner-loser effects on exploration behavior over longer time periods. Latencies for control crickets (n=20) were measured at the same time points, but controls did not engage in a fight. Winning crickets' latency times decreased following the contest, while losing crickets' latency times increased. This suggests that individuals' emotional states were changed by the experience of the fight and affected exploration tendencies. These data on invertebrate emotions have important implications on human health by allowing for future studies on the mechanisms behind mental states."],

This statistic raises an important question in terms of substantive (policy) representation for women: how does women's substantive representation occur when they constitute such a small proportion of policymakers? Scholars have hypothesized that substantive representation requires either a critical mass of women or critical actors to push legislation through to success. I propose instead that the answer to this question may lie in gendered patterns of collaboration among legislators. While I expect women to introduce most of the bills addressing issues affecting women's issues, I also expect gendered authorship patterns to emerge vis-a-vis bills addressing these topics, particularly those that are passed into law. As such, I plan to answer this question by examining various factors that may impact the success of legislation, particularly legislation addressing women's issues. These factors include the party, gender, and seniority of author(s)/coauthor(s), whether those individuals hold influential chamber leadership positions, whether the topic of the bill addresses a women's issue directly, and the stage in the legislative process at which each bill ended. This data will be collected for the 2020 legislative session."],

Media coverage for MMIWG survivors in United States and Canada remains lacking, as mainstream reporting is almost non-existent for Indigenous women and girls. Out of 506 MMIWG cases, only one-quarter were reported by local, regional, or national media (UIHI, 2018). These victims are commonly overshadowed by other cases comprised of non-Hispanic White (NHW) women who go missing. In Canada's local press, missing and murdered NHW women were referred to 511 times compared to 82 times for Indigenous women (Gilchrist, 2010). Further, Indigenous women and girls who are abuse survivors and are reported in the media are usually depicted in negative and stereotypical contexts like sex-work and criminal behavior, which is in stark contrast to their NHW counterparts. However, advocates of the MMIWG epidemic have created increased social media exposure by sharing survivors' stories. During an 11-month study using data from Twitter, over 107,400 tweets included #MMIW and #MMIWG; these hashtags were used to shift perceptions of Indigenous women/girls and to apply political pressure to increasing news coverage of current rates of MMIWG (Moeke-Pickering et al., 2018). Increasing Indigenous representation and exposure via the media creates the opportunity to generate discussions, encourage activism, and ultimately, promote systemic-level changes for justice among Indigenous women and girls.

This carotenoid coloration signals bird health, with many factors influencing adult beak color development, including stress and immune challenges during early life. Like many bird species, zebra finches are biparental. However, few studies have tested how paternal removal affects offspring development. We tested how paternal removal affected beak coloration of sons. We set up two treatment groups: one group that had the father removed from the nest at hatching (early removal) and another that had the father removed at fledging (late removal), as well as a control group with no paternal removal. Once adults, we measured the brightness, hue, and saturation of the upper mandible of male offspring using a spectrophotometer. Birds in the late removal group had breaks with significantly lower red reflectance in comparison to the control group.

Although often overlooked by the general public, compressors are used in a wide range of heating and air-conditioning applications, and they account for approximately five percent of the energy consumption in the United States alone. As indicated by recent research on climate change, it is more important than ever to wisely manage energy use in all its forms. Therefore, it is imperative that greater focus be placed on the development and use of more energy-efficient compressors. Nevertheless, progress in this field is often hindered by the lack of a unified format with which to present compressor performance data. Different companies, organizations, and individuals present information about the compressors they have developed or studied in whichever format they prefer. As a result, it can be cumbersome to compare the performance characteristics of different compressors. In the worst case, it can even result in the selection or development of a less efficient compressor for a particular application. In an effort to resolve this problem, a database was created for the purpose of storing compressor performance data in a unified format. Data verification methods ensure that all data contained in the database is consistent, allowing users to easily compare performance data collected with different compressors. Furthermore, the database can even be used to train data-driven or machine learning compressor models. These models will expedite the selection and development of efficient compressors for general and specific applications. Finally, a user interface for data entry will allow new performance data to be entered as it becomes available, ensuring the continued usefulness of the database."],

        "We suggest that soil moisture sensors can help farmers alleviate stress related to water management by improving irrigation precision and efficiency. Soil moisture sensors can collect data more quickly, more thoroughly, and more efficiently than traditional methods of soil moisture monitoring.",
        "This project compiled local opinions on sensor technology and compared the performance and user interface of two commercially available sensors, CropX and Sentek Drill-n-Drop. We installed two CropX sensors and two Sentek sensors on cotton fields in early June 2021 in southwest Oklahoma. We tracked soil water content from the sensors throughout the 2021 growing season. During this time, we also interviewed farmers in the area to better understand their opinions and goals regarding water management and sensor use.",
        "We found that the sensors provide valuable and accurate data, but poor internet connection as well as sensor user interface could make adopting sensors difficult. Because Oklahoma has the fourth highest number of farms in the United States as well as a history of detrimental drought, the state is a relevant and valuable model for research in more sustainable and efficient irrigation methods. Therefore, the results of this study can be used in a myriad of ways in Oklahoma and beyond."],

      abstract: ["The objective of this experiment was to ascertain if supplementing calcium propionate (CaP) in varying amounts would result in the increased expression of genes related to glucose metabolism in the liver. The study utilized cannulated Holstein steers (n = 6) in a replicated 3x3 Latin square with three 15-d periods. The treatments were as follows: Control (no CaP), low propionate (100 g/d CaP), and high propionate (300 g/d CaP). The treatments were administered in halves twice a day through rumen cannulas. The steers were provided with ad libitum finishing ration, using Insentec feeders to record intake, and unrestricted access to water. Liver biopsies were taken on d15 of each treatment and flash-frozen using liquid nitrogen. RNA was extracted from the liver tissue, reverse transcribed for cDNA, and analyzed through quantitative real-time PCR. Five genes were selected as target genes due to their involvement in gluconeogenesis and included solute carrier family 16 member 1 (SLC16A1), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (PCK1), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 2 (PCK2), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC), and solute carrier family 2 member 2 (SLC2A2). Data were analyzed using a mixed model with treatment, period, and their interaction included as fixed effects and steer as a random effect. There was no treatment effect on hepatic gene expression (P >/= 0.57). SLC16A1 showed a strong, negative, linear relationship with d7 plasma lactate concentration (r = -0.84, P < .0001) and a moderate, negative relationship with fasting plasma lactate concentration (r = -0.55, P = 0.028). SLC2A2 tended to show a moderate, positive, linear relationship with fasting plasma glucose (r = 0.44, P = 0.09), fasting plasma lactate concentration (r = 0.43, P = 0.09), and glucose area under the curve (r = 0.46, P = 0.07). These data indicate that increased propionate may not have an impact on hepatic gene expression."],

The Dark Triad describes three personality traits significantly associated with difficulties in interpersonal relationships. While some argue that psychopathy and Machiavellianism are extremely similar (Miller et al., 2016), a number of researchers argue they are different enough to be separate constructs. Recent studies have found gender differences within psychopathy or Machiavellianism individually. Specifically, men expressed higher levels of both psychopathy traits (Miller et al., 2010) and Machiavellianism traits (Collison et al., 2020). However, no study has examined gender differences in both Machiavellianism and psychopathy. The goal of this study is to provide further evidence of gender differences shown in the expression of Machiavellianism and psychopathy traits within one sample.",
        "Methods: Participants (N = 191) for the current study were undergraduate college students from Oklahoma State University who worked over 20 hours a week, as this data comes from a larger study that assessed workplace behaviors. Participants were given research credits for participation. Participants completed a variety of self-report measures to assess psychopathy, Machiavellianism, and narcissism. These measures included demographic information (e.g. sex), The Dirty Dozen (DD; Jonason & Webster, 2010), Elemental Psychopathy Assessment (EPA; Lynam et al., 2011), and Mach-IV Scale (Christie & Geis, 1970). The sample was 71.8% female and 74.8% Caucasian. Gender differences will be measured for Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and narcissism.

      abstract: ["This paper presents the results of testing the effects of nozzle area ratio , nozzle  downstream location propeller shape, and propeller size to determine the feasibility of a variable-cycle turboprop/turbojet powerplant for small unmanned applications. The motivation of this project is to inform design decisions for a single aircraft with both high-speed dash and high-endurance  loiter capabilities, creating a package that can perform both long range and long-duration  surveillance . In this study, thrust was evaluated through static testing of a modified 6.7 horsepower KingTech K45TP engine with  an array of turbojet nozzle exit diameters  from 1.57in (40mm)  to 0.94in (24mm), with offset from the turboprop exhaust exit between 0.75 inches and 1.75 inches. Additional testing was accomplished to measure static thrust with the different nozzle exit diameters and locations in turboprop mode with 2- and 3-bladed, 20-inch diameter propellers. Turbojet mode was achieved by locking the propeller to prevent rotation. Based on initial results, it appears that while the turboprop configuration generates excellent thrust across many nozzle diameters and offsets, the turboprop  has difficulty generating usable thrust with the propeller's turbine locked in the flow. Comparison of the propellers indicates that the 3-bladed Biela produced more thrust with no decrement to operability. Future research should consider rocket-assisted take-off for high-speed flight with a folding propeller, rather than attempting to achieve high-speed flight in a turbojet mode. Follow-on developments should include design and implementation of a mechanism for releasing the folding propeller after high-speed flight."],

      abstract: ["Technology is becoming increasingly prominent in today’s society, and children are being exposed to screens at younger ages than in previous years. This exposure has led to teachers and parents questioning how technology use may be affecting children’s vocabulary skills. Previous research has primarily focused on technology’s effect on reading skills in school age children and thus leaves gaps in knowledge regarding technology’s effect on younger children (Yienger, 2016). In addition, other studies have shown that an increase in screen time is associated with a decrease in learning (Neophytou et al., 2019). However, these types of studies focus on learning as a whole, and do not provide data on vocabulary use exclusively. Thus, the current study examines the correlations between technology use and vocabulary development in infants and toddlers. It was hypothesized that an increase in technology use would be associated with lowered vocabulary skills in children. In this study, parents were asked to report how often their kids use tablets and handheld devices, and also reported their children’s vocabulary through the Mac-Arthur Bates Communicative Development Inventory checklist (Fenson et al., 1994). There was not a significant correlation between amount of technology use and vocabulary percentile, r(249)=.055, p=.388. There was, however, a correlation between technology use and age, r(265)=.230, p<.001. The results suggest that an increased amount of screen time does not lead to lower levels of vocabulary in children. Results also showed that as children age, they are utilizing more technology than younger children, yet their vocabulary skills do not appear to be affected by this increase. These results can have certain implications, such as parents and teachers having peace of mind knowing that some technology use will not affect their toddlers’ vocabulary, and that they can continue to use technology to further their kids’ learning."],

      abstract: ["Due to the growing popularity of sports climbing and other grip strength dependent sports, there has been increasing interest in determining the best method of intermittent recovery during extended climbing bouts in order to help combat forearm and finger flexor fatigue. The two main methods utilized by climbers to do so are 'shaking out' and passive stretching via wrist and finger extension. Presumably, these techniques are used to reduce the occluded arterial inflow brought upon by intramuscular pressure, which reduces oxygenation of the active muscles.",
        "Methods: 44 college-age males and females were randomly assigned to 3 groups: 'shaking out', stretching, and resting (control) with the arms at the side. Prior to assessing a maximal hang time, each participant's grip strength was measured. Subsequently, each participant was asked to hang by the proximal interphalangeal joints of digits 2-5 for maximal time. Following the maximal hang time the participants performed, one of the three protocols for 30 s and grip strength was again assessed and a second maximal hang time was recorded. Data was compared by repeated measures ANOVA with an alpha level set at p<0.05.",
        "Results: There were no significant differences among pre- grip strength results between the groups and no significant (p>0.05) differences from pre- to post grip strength assessments for any of the conditions. However, the shake and stretch conditions recorded slightly larger post-test grip deficits (-13.3% and -13.1% respectively) than the rest condition (-8.1%). For maximal hang time no pre-hang significant (p>0.05) differences were found among the conditions. However, each condition registered significant (p<0.05) pre- to posttest changes and no significant differences were found among the conditions.",
        "Conclusion: While the rest condition resulted in slightly less grip strength fatigue following maximal hang time, post-hang time was not affected by any of the conditions presented in this research. These results suggest that none of the protocols used in the current study is superior in reducing occlusion and restoring of muscle oxygenation."],

      abstract: ["The study refers to the identification of b-jets (streams of particles created through hadronization of b-quarks) observed by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. It eventually aims for the detection of signals due to long-lived particles from Higgs boson decays predicted by various theories beyond the standard model. The applications of this study could potentially extrapolate the b-tagging performance used on tt-bar to ZH events, allowing for uncertainties for the ZH events to be analyzed. The tt-bar events are simulations of top-anti-top quark pairs that decay into b-quarks and are easily produced, being ideal for training algorithms. However, ZH events model the production of b quarks through the decay of Higgs-like, long-lived particles that are difficult to produce thus unsuitable to train algorithms. The methods used were to apply the same techniques of b-tagging on ZH and reweighting to account for differences in kinematic dependencies. Then tt-bar can be used to train algorithms for a better fit of the ZH events. However, the properties in these decay processes are different, and the ZH sample has decays more displaced from the beam interaction point than the tt-bar samples making the efficiencies different. To functionally make the efficiencies the same, cuts were applied to only include entries of b-hadron decay paths that are collinear with the path of the long-lived particles. In this way, the study concludes that the algorithms are not optimized for b-jets that originate far from the beam interaction point and algorithms need improvement for future studies."],

This was especially true in Nazi Germany when religious conviction led some people to risk their lives to do what they believed was right, others allowed their religion to be transformed and co-opted by the Nazis to fit a political agenda while meeting spiritual needs, and still others simply tried to ignore the cognitive dissonance of obeying an authority that was acting in direct contradiction to a spiritual one. This paper will examine the role of Christianity in resistance movements against the Nazis with a focus on the White Rose in an attempt to explain how members of the same religion could have had such drastically different responses to the National Socialists."],

Strachan has navigated the difficulties of transnational and comparative scholarship by drawing upon material culture. By using physical objects to help make her argument, Strachan explores a type of primary source that many historians do not draw upon. As she considers these ceramics, she participates in a critical discussion about orientalism and the way trade, travel, and racial stereotypes influence one another. Additionally, we have all seen the pottery that her essay discusses, because chinaware is still a major part of American culture in some regions of the United States. Strachan's essay critically examines the origins and consequences of this cultural borrowing and forces us to do the same. – Sarah Capps"],

Our undergraduate editors, who were selected from a large and competitive pool of nominees, have brought wit, work, and fair-mindedness to the task of selecting these papers. The papers we selected show how many hours our faculty has spent guiding students through the best historiography, and drilling them with the technical aspects of scholarly work. Our students have worked with impressive focus to master the discipline of historical study. As these papers display, OU history majors reproduce in their own work the spirit of intellectual rigor and aesthetic play that animates the finest scholarship.",
        "In each of these papers, we find deep research, sophisticated analysis, and distinguished literary style.*    All break new ground. Whether they find new things to say about familiar figures like Benjamin Franklin, or new data on events surrounding the Kent State killings, each article has a freshness, a novelty, and a sparkle of youthful insight that made the professors who oversaw them proud.",
        "Here is a sample. Arthur Dixon—who, I assure you, is an undergraduate—writes the following on an anonymous chronicle of twelfth century Sicily: I cannot make any definitive suggestions for the chronicle’s authorship on [the basis of internal evidence] alone, but the argument for normalizing discourse erodes the cases for the two candidates cited by Graham A. Loud: Robert of San Giovanni and Eugenius of Palermo, “son of the Emir John.” The former was a Latin notary who followed Stephen of Perche. His cultural loyalties match up well, but his personal loyalties suggest that he was not caught up in the move toward normalization. The latter was a Greek palace official and intellectual who would hardly have advocated the reconstruction of Sicily on mainland European foundations. Unfortunately, reading the History of the Tyrants as a testament to the normalization of medieval Sicily only offers vague parameters of ethnicity and ideology for the chronicle’s elusive author. This study can clarify who Falcandus was not, but it cannot pinpoint who he was.",

        "The papers we publish in the first issue of the OU Historical Journal are thus the product of an enormous amount of intellectual work: the work of the administrators who coordinate the many courses offered in the history department, the work of our faculty members, who devote passion and precision to teaching the subjects they love, and most importantly, the work of our undergraduates, who struggle, strive, and sometimes triumph in the rigorous discipline of historical scholarship.  This journal is a tribute to the extraordinary daily efforts of all the above, and a testimony to the kinds of achievement that their collective labors make possible.",
        "A few words are in order about our editorial board.  Our five undergraduate editors were nominated by faculty members who had taught them, and voted on by the history faculty as a whole.  Their election to the editorial board recognizes their excellence in a broad variety of history courses at OU.  It marks their transition from being students in our department to being among its intellectual leaders.  Tessa Blanchard, Meghan Riley, Michael Carter, Ryan Geary, and Scott Renner deserve high praise for the hard work they applied to the tasks of conceiving and promoting the journal, collecting submissions, and selecting works for publication.",
        "The criteria we used for the selection of these papers were the same ones the department employs in the senior capstone course.  Developed by Professor Melissa Stockdale, and approved by the faculty as a whole, these criteria can be found here.  In publishing them, we hope to let the university community know about the intellectual values we espouse as a department: hard work, rigorous thinking, distinction in style, and honesty in crediting our sources and scholarly peers.",

But like the flash of an explosion, this radical ideology left a bright spot in the vision of Spain’s women for years to come.

The volatile and lively debates surrounding the island nation's successes and failures spark up with new vigor each time a study is published, like a flame fed gasoline. Lydia Chávez, a professor at the University of California, brought a group of journalism students to Cuba to teach them how to report on foreign affairs in 2001. This visit became the basis for this book. It portrays Cuba as still in the midst of a transition that should have been concluded soon after the end of the revolution in 1959. To merely say Cuba is between capitalism and socialism would not quite capture the complex reality on the ground. Socialism developed unevenly in the decades following the revolution; aspects of capitalism disappeared and reappeared in new forms as the US embargo and fall of the USSR took its toll on the country. Chávez sees this uneven development best embodied in her memory of poor children with eyeglasses begging for dollars. People who are starving still receive other types of healthcare. Cuba is full of seeming contradictions. This book, a collection of impressions of Cuban society written by her students, has much to contribute to the debate but falls short of providing a complete view of Cuban society in the twentieth century."],

The origins of the plot, hatched by the devious Bosomworth family to take greater control of the eastern trading path from Charleston to Creek country, tap deeply into disagreements between two neighboring tribes, the Cowetas and Cussetas, both striving to be the predominant clan among the Lower Creeks.

The use of a religious framework receives a lot of attention in the popular imagination, pitting Islam against Judaism. There are numerous problems with this paradigm, but one problem that often goes unnoticed is the erasure of Arab Christian involvement within the conflict. This erasure causes an oversight in regards to the very important contributions Christians made to the development of Arab nationalism. This oversight causes the fundamental misunderstanding that the conflict is religious and not political. A historical examination of Arab Christian involvement can break away from this paradigm. It can also develop a deeper understanding of the conflict. Focusing the analysis on the British Mandatory period, with special regard to Christian involvement in the nationalist movement, one can gain insight into the critical moments of the conflict and the necessary processes for its maturation into what it is today. However, to understand these developments, one must understand the historical movement of Arab Christians within the branch of Arab nationalism that reacted against Zionism. The British mandatory period was the critical period in determining the future scope of the conflict and the manner in which it has continued to unfold. In so doing, one will find that Arab Christians were disproportionately influential in the Palestinian nationalist movement, but their role gradually subsided as a result of increasing Islamic rhetoric, British policy, internal sectarian divisions, and Zionist political maneuvering."],

        "My name is James Hart and I am the new Chairman of the History Department. Welcome to the second annual edition of the University of Oklahoma Historical Journal. The Historical journal has been developed in the last two years as a product of the department’s long-standing commitment to excellence in undergraduate research and writing. In recent years, we have developed a three-step training program for undergraduate history majors designed to develop and enhance writing skills. The History Sleuth is our basic historical methods class, introducing students to the wide variety of issues surrounding the nature of historical evidence and instructing them in the use and presentation of that evidence in support of an historical argument. The Colloquium that follows is a writing intensive course challenging students to apply those skills to different kinds of writing assignments which deal with different kinds of historical problems. Both courses then lead to the Capstone which focuses attention on a single, major research project in a particular field of history. This course allows students to immerse themselves in the literature of a chosen field, to develop their own ideas about the ‘hows’ and ‘whys’ of a particular historical problem, and then to marshal and synthesize their evidence to support an original argument.",
        "The papers presented below are all products of that evolutionary process. This year, the Journal received twenty five submissions, all of which were considered carefully by the editorial board. The editorial board then selected six of those they considered outstanding to be published here. As you will see, the papers are notable not only for their intrinsic quality, but for the enormous range of topics undertaken by our student scholars.",
        "Next year, we hope to enhance this process further with another innovation. The department has this year undertaken a reform of our traditional American History survey courses, history 1483 and History 1493, which are required for all of OU’s undergraduates. We have redesigned our approach to make research and writing a central component of these courses as well. Instead of a three-day lecture format, students will have lectures two days a week and the third meeting will be given over to a small discussion sessions. The lectures will be offered only by senior history faculty who will bring to the classroom a wealth of experience in both teaching and research. The discussion sessions will then be guided by advanced graduate students who will be specially trained in writing and research pedagogy by members of OU’s expository writing faculty. It is our hope that this course will serve as a gateway course to many other classes at the University of Oklahoma. Like the above mentioned classes, it will introduce students to the means and methods of original research, but more important, will allow them to develop their own voice, to articulate their own ideas and arguments, both orally and in writing, in a way than enhances their educational experience and benefits us all. They will, we hope, eventually join the ranks of the prize-winning essayists below. We hope you will enjoy all of these endeavors."],

      abstract: ["After ROTC cadets graduate, they will become officers and leaders within the military. One responsibility they will have initially is being a leader to at least 50 Soldiers. Soldiers will regularly approach their commanding officer for advice on all topics, including weight management, nutrition, and health. However, these officers are not formally trained in providing such guidance to their Soldiers, which could have negative health and performance implications for the Soldier and the greater military.",
        "Considering that cadets immediately take on leadership roles with a far reach, ROTC could be a big impact solution to the weight concerns of the military, but are they interested? Cadets and their instructors are very interested in such classes though. According to focus group data from my current Wentz project, cadets and instructors ranked nutrition as 4.8/5 and 5/5, respectively, for interest in nutrition classes and 4.3/5 and 5/5, respectively, for importance of nutrition classes to their future military career. They are particularly interested in cooking classes. Cadets and instructors have informed the research team one area of concern is the low food literacy of cadets, which is different from low nutrition knowledge."],

      abstract: ["Food insecurity is a prevalent issue in college campuses across the country. The Hunger on Campus study found that 48% of college students face food insecurity. Oklahoma State University (OSU) also experiences high rates of food insecurity. A recent study found that approximately 42% of OSU Stillwater students were food insecure and sophomores, upperclassmen, and minority students were at the highest risk. The 2020 study found the food insecure students at OSU were not utilizing the food security resources available to them. The purpose of this mixed methods study was to understand why students are not utilizing the available food security resources. The first phase was qualitative and utilized interviews with sophomores, juniors, and senior-level OSU students to identify obstacles preventing resource utilization. Randomized email lists were used for recruitment, and participation was encouraged in ethnically diverse campus organizations. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed for emerging themes. The quantitative phase was informed by the interview results, and included a social media campaign promoted throughout campus using A-Frames. This intervention utilized the social media platform Instagram to promote available resources to students. Student engagement in the intervention was measured by the number of QR scans and Instagram analytics. To measure the effectiveness of increasing resource awareness, a survey was administered to Instagram followers through a direct message. The results of the qualitative phase demonstrated a major limitation in student resource usage is a lack of awareness, and the best way to distribute information on campus was social media and A-Frames. Overall, students at OSU Stillwater are facing food insecurity but are not aware of the resources available; the use of A-frames and social media demonstrate potential to increase awareness. The long-term implication of this study is a reduced prevalence of food insecurity at OSU Stillwater's campus."],

      abstract: ["Objectives: Postprandial triglycerides (TG), or levels of fat in the blood after a meal, are an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) (1). A clinically feasible test to assess postprandial TG has been developed, known as the Abbreviated Fat Tolerance Test (AFTT) (2), however the impact of coffee consumption prior to an AFTT on postprandial TG is largely unknown. Notably, approximately half of Americans consume at least one cup of coffee before or with breakfast (3), therefore understanding whether coffee intake impacts AFTT results is practical. This study aimed to investigate the effect of coffee consumption prior to an AFTT on postprandial TG, in order to determine whether coffee intake prior to an AFTT affects its validity. Methods: Participants completed 2 randomized AFTTs separated by at least 1 week, but not exceeding 2 weeks. For each AFTT, participants arrived into the laboratory following a 10-hour overnight fast and consumed either 1 cup of water or black coffee. Thirty-minutes later, a baseline blood draw was collected. Immediately following, participants consumed a standardized high-fat shake (73% fat; 9 kcal/kg body mass), vacated the laboratory, and returned 4 hours later for a follow-up blood draw. Results: Six healthy individuals (3 Women, 3 Men; age 21.3 ± 3.2; BMI 25.9 ± 1.6) completed the present study. Two-way ANOVA of TG revealed a significant overall time effect (p = 0.008), but not time x trial interaction (p = 0.87) or overall trial effect (p = 0.27). Absolute change in TG was not different between trials (p = 0.61). Conclusion: In our small study sample, coffee intake prior to an AFTT did not affect postprandial TG. Therefore, coffee intake prior to an AFTT may not affect the validity of the AFTT. Further research should investigate the effects of coffee consumption prior to an AFTT on the validity of the AFTT in a larger, more diverse study population."],

      abstract: ["Hormones play an important role in animal social behavior, including competitive behaviors. Previous studies demonstrate that the hormone Arginine Vasotocin (AVT) modulates the calling behavior of different frog species. Male frogs produce acoustic advertisement calls to attract females and compete with one another by increasing their call rate and call duration. Previously, AVT has been shown to correlate with increased call rate and call duration; however, how competition influences this relationship remains unknown. We investigated how the effects of AVT would be impacted by different competitive environments in the gray treefrog Hyla chrysoscelis. We predicted that increased competition would further amplify the effects of AVT on call rate and call duration. Frogs were caught and injected with either a saline control (n=14) or AVT (n=23) and then sequentially exposed to noncompetitive, moderately competitive, and highly competitive environments via playbacks of synthetic calls with differing call rates and durations. Frogs injected with AVT had higher call rates but no change in call duration. AVT frogs also had higher duty cycles in noncompetitive environments, suggesting that AVT may offer reproductive benefits in noncompetitive environments, but that these benefits are lost in competitive environments. This data provides insight on how AVT influences behavior, which has important implications for the overall competitiveness of the individual and the individual's subsequent reproductive success."],

      abstract: ["Metachronal paddling is a form of locomotion common in pelagic crustaceans such as krill, in which a series of swimming appendages are stroked in an oscillatory pattern, each appendage with a phase lag compared to the neighboring appendage. In contrast, benthic crustaceans such as mantis shrimp spend most of their time on the seafloor, and perform a hybrid paddling stroke when startled that consists of a metachronal power stroke, followed by a nearly synchronous recovery stroke. We developed a dynamically scaled, self-propelling robotic paddling model, which was programmed to perform three types of idealized paddling strokes (uniformly metachronal, synchronous, hybrid with uniformly metachronal power stroke and synchronous recovery stroke), and a realistic stroke profile tracked from videos of freely swimming peacock mantis shrimp (O. Scyllarus). Using this robotic model, we evaluated the forward swimming performance of these different paddling strategies by measuring thrust, swimming speed, and acceleration generated by each stroke pattern. When stroke amplitude and appendage tip velocity during power stroke are unchanged between idealized stroke patterns, the uniformly metachronal pattern had the highest performance values in each evaluation category, followed by the hybrid pattern, with synchronous paddling showing the lowest values in each category. However, the use of hybrid kinematics allows for the possibility of increasing stroke amplitude, allowing the appendages to sweep longer arcs during power stroke. The effect of increasing stroke amplitude on forward swimming performance of these stroke patterns will be discussed."],

This study is the focal point of a long-term germplasm introgression and development project with the goal of producing market-ready germplasm with enhanced nutritional value. Purple wheat might provide health benefits and generate additional value for the health foods marketplace. The genetic material in this study included 29 full sib experimental lines and their three parents. Grain was produced in three locations: Yuma, Arizona (2020), Stillwater (2021), and Lahoma, Oklahoma (2021). Wheat was milled into a whole-meal flour and extracted with acidified methanol for assays. Anthocyanin concentration, total phenolic content, and two radical scavenging assays were used. Compared to white phenotypes, purple genotypes had significantly higher anthocyanin concentrations (142 to 298%) in each environment and higher total phenolics (103.85 and 105%) in the 2021 environments. Additionally, delayed harvest appeared to be associated with decreased anthocyanin and phenolic concentrations in purple wheat, which could point to the importance of timely harvest to preserve pigments and nutritional functionality. Evaluation is ongoing with the expectation that one of the purple lines will be suitable for commercial production in the southern Plains states."],

When the CFTR gene is mutated, it causes the protein to be absent or lose function, which leads to dehydration in the lung's airways and also traps mucus inside the lungs. These conditions in the lung generate a perfect environment for bacterial colonization by multiple different species. Chronic bacterial colonization and development of antibiotic resistance are serious concerns for CF patients. Previous studies looking at antibiotic resistant bacteria focused on a specific genus species and it is possible that highly resistant bacteria were missed, whereas this study aims to identify overall resistant bacteria. This study aims to identify highly resistant bacterial populations directly from the sputa of CF patients in Oklahoma. Total bacterial populations from CF sputa were previously collected and cryogenically frozen. Samples from 41 patients were screened for high resistance to four antibiotics: Ticaracillin, Gentamycin, Polymixin B and Carbenicllin. Resistance was measured via Kriby-Bauer disc assays. A total of 11 highly resistant bacteria were identified which are currently being assessed for MICs and will be identified by 16S sequencing."],

Environmental stress can be caused by a variety of factors, including acid, alcohol, salt, and heat. We are studying the model bacterium Bacillus subtilis, because its stress response resembles that of human pathogens such as Listeria. B. subtilis senses stress using a stressosome, a complex of 80 proteins that includes four variant RsbR protein paralogs, each of which produce a distinct stress response pattern to an identical stressor. We know that these four RsbR proteins work together to aid in survival in the presence of environmental stress in wild-type cells (WT), which contain all four RsbR proteins; however, we do not know how each RsbR protein affects cell fitness. To test how each individual RsbR protein affects survival, we performed a competition assay pairing strains containing individual RsbR variants against each other to determine if one protein aided in cell survival more than the other. To do this, we engineered strains of B. subtilis cells to only contain one of the four RsbR proteins. This allowed us to compete the RsbR proteins against one another on an individual basis. Our preliminary results indicate that the wild-type strain substantially outcompeted the other strains in every competition assay performed under acid stress except when competed against RC. These results show that cells containing only RC or all four RsbR proteins have a higher fitness in acid stress than cells containing only RA, RB, or RD."],

In this study, a novel cable-driven linear actuator is designed that can provide both axial tension and compression forces, and be capable of extending to a final length that is over twice its original length. It uses a set of wires arranged in a helix configuration that extends or contracts axially due to a torsional rotation. These wires are constrained from shifting laterally and from buckling when under compression.

With few antifungal drugs, high toxicity, and increased resistance to antifungals, the importance of finding new antifungal therapies is crucial. We hypothesized that novel organoantimony compounds would effectively restrict fungal growth. We tested approximately 20 compounds against C. neoformans and C. albicans in minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays. Compounds A, B, E, I, F, and G were effective against C. neoformans with MIC concentrations of 10.94 ug/ml, 19.79 ug/ml, 18.75 ug/ml, 12.5 ug/ml, 20.83 ug/ml, and 2.60 ug/ml, respectively.

Previous studies over spider predation of frogs have consisted of pairing larger spider and frog species together, and smaller spider and frog species together. This was so they could determine if predators could eat prey that was similar to their own size. For our experiment, we expanded on this idea by examining the predator-prey size relations within just one spider species, the wolf spider. This was to eliminate the confounding variable of differing strategic predation methods that vary between species. This study focuses on how the size of wolf spiders can influence their ability to successfully capture prey. The experiment was carried out in a system of glass aquaria where wolf spiders were collected locally and fasted for seven days. Once the fasting period was over, an individual frog was placed into each enclosure where then the 48 hour trial began. At the end of the trial the frog condition was recorded as either alive and untouched, dead and untouched, or dead and consumed. Our data did not generate a correlation between spider and frog size, but instead showed that spiders were able to capture prey that were both smaller and larger than themselves. We plan to next focus on the nutritional aspect of spider predation by running a lipid analysis on the frog remains collected as well as repeating this experiment again using crickets as prey. The results from the lipid analysis over the frog and cricket remains will determine how much nutrients wolf spiders are consuming when they hunt their prey. The importance of this study is that it expands our understanding of the North American species of wolf spider whereas most previous studies have been over tropical spider species."],

The dear enemy effect allows for a decrease in time and energy expenditure by fighting less often. With the global increase in invasive species, more organisms are having to compete with individuals of new invading species to establish territories. For instance, Anolis carolinensis (Green Anole) is endemic to the southeastern U.S., and Anolis sagrei (Brown Anole) occurs on many Caribbean islands, but was introduced into Florida in the mid-1900s and now interacts with green anoles. These species are known to compete with one another for territories, and there is concern that A. sagrei is displacing the native A. carolinensis ( Edwards and Lailvaux 2013).

The new innovation, the 'drop' model is a brand's strategy that consists of releasing a new product or collection at a specific time in limited quantities (Elven, 2018). Product drops impose a sense of urgency and scarcity to increase sales by making customers buy the product right away at full prices. It also creates 'brand excitement as a method to build consumer affinity' (Larsson, 2020). The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of the drop model on fashion brands' business strategies and sustainability. Three research objectives were established: (a) to investigate the fashion brands' current business strategies for the 'drop model' including product development, marketing communications, and supply chain,(b) to examine whether the drop model has any positive implications for sustainability, and (c) to evaluate how the drop model could be compared with traditional business models such as fast fashion and how fashion brands should move forward in the coming years. To achieve the research objectives, content analysis, and a case study approach were adopted. I examined selected cases that were useful in supplying insight into a topic of interest and in leading to a better understanding of a research phenomenon. Based on the result of the content analysis, I selected three sample brands that have adopted the drop model. Within the case study, each sample brand's drop model strategies in terms of product development, marketing communications, and supply chain were be analyzed using content analysis and other unobtrusive observation measures. The sample brands' websites and social media sites were also investigated. Conclusions from my research revealed the 'drop model' promotes more sustainable practices by eliminating overproduction in the fashion industry. The drop model generates exclusivity, demand, excitement, and incentive in the product market. Long-term sustainability through the retail strategy of the drop model could be achieved if applied properly with high-quality products and lines."],

OFFN consists of common configurations of Software Defined Networking infrastructure connected across a new set of optical links, at a minimum of 10 Gbps, and foreshadowing the state's transition to widespread 100 Gbps research connectivity. OneOCII, the parent initiative of OFFN, is a statewide collaboration to offer shared access to resources, both technology and human, to enable the use of advanced computing by research and education statewide. To date, OneOCII has served 52 academic institutions and 48 non-academic organizations."],

By coordinating with campus services, we were able to avoid any additional costs to the students or the university. Students built three twelve-unit independently-operating clusters. Working groups were formed for each cluster and they installed the operating system, created users, connected to the campus network and wrote a variety of scripts and parallel programs while documenting the process. We describe how we solved unexpected problems encountered along the way. We illustrate through pre- and post-course surveys that students gained substantial knowledge in fundamental aspects of HPC through the hands-on approach of creating their own clusters."],

Unfortunately, many mass storage systems are prohibitively expensive at scales appropriate for individual institutions rather than for national centers. Furthermore, a key issue is the set of circumstances under which researchers can, and are willing to, adopt a centralized technology that, in a pure cost recovery model, might be, or might appear to be, more expensive than what the research teams could build on their own. This paper examines a business model that addresses these concerns in a comprehensive manner, distributing the costs among a funding agency, the institution and the research teams, thereby reducing the challenges faced by each."],
